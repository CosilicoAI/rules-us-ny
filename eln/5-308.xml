If a voter appears at a primary election and votes by affidavit\nballot indicating the intent to enroll in such party, such affidavit\nballot shall be cast and counted if the board of elections determines\nthat the voter registered (or pre-registered) to vote at least ten days\nbefore that primary pursuant to title nine of this article and such\nvoter is otherwise qualified to vote in such election.\n</p>
