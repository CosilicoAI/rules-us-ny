          <p>  § 5-601. Registration records; physically disabled voters. 1. A\nphysically disabled voter whose polling place is located in a building\nthat is not accessible shall be entitled to vote in any other election\ndistrict whose polling place is located in a building which is\naccessible, provided that the candidates and ballot proposals on the\nballot in such other election district are the same as those on the\nballot in the election district in which such voter resides.\n  2. A written application by a disabled voter to have his registration\nrecord transferred to an election district which has an accessible\npolling place shall be valid for an election occurring more than\nfourteen days after it is received by the board of elections and, if the\nvoter is permanently disabled, for all subsequent elections. Such\napplication may specify the election district to which the voter wishes\nhis registration records transferred.\n  3. The board of elections shall keep all such applications from\npermanently disabled voters on file at its office.  Not later than\ntwelve days before each election, the board shall transfer the records\nof each voter for whom it has such an application and who continues to\nbe registered from the address on such application to an election\ndistrict in the polling place specified in such application. If the\napplication does not specify such an election district, or if the\nelection district so specified is not one to which such records properly\nmay be transferred for such election, the board of elections shall\ntransfer such record to the election district among those to which it\nmay properly be transferred for such election, which is located in the\naccessible polling place closest to the residence of the applicant.\n  4. If such registration records are in the form of registration poll\nrecords, the board of elections, before transferring any such\nregistration record, shall make a photocopy thereof. Such photocopies\nshall be kept on file in the offices of such board in case such\nregistration poll record is lost.\n  5. Upon removing such a registration poll record from a poll ledger,\nthe board of elections shall insert in such poll ledger, at the place\nwhere such registration poll record was filed, a form giving the name\nand address of the voter, stating that the registration poll record was\nmoved pursuant to the provisions of this section and giving the number\nof the election district to which such registration poll record was\nmoved and the location of the polling place for such election district.\n  6. If such registration records are kept in the form of computer\ngenerated registration lists, the board of elections at the time such\nregistration record is transferred, shall cause to be entered on the\ncomputer generated registration at the place where such registration\nrecord would have appeared, the name and address of the voter but\nwithout the computer reproduced facsimile of the voter's signature and\neither a notation that such record was moved pursuant to the provisions\nof this section together with the number of the election district to\nwhich such record was moved and the location of the polling place for\nsuch election district or a notation stating where, in such computer\ngenerated registration list, such information is provided.\n  7. Not later than ten days before each election, the board of\nelections shall mail to each voter who has made application pursuant to\nthe provisions of this section, by first class mail, information\nspecifying the number and location of the election district to which his\nrecords have been transferred or that there is no election district to\nwhich such records may properly be transferred which is located in an\naccessible polling place.\n  8. If the board determines that there is no election district in an\naccessible polling place to which such voter's record may properly be\ntransferred for a particular election, it shall treat the application of\nsuch voter as an application for an absentee ballot for such election\nand forthwith mail such absentee ballot to such voter at his residence\naddress together with the notice required by subdivision seven of this\nsection.\n  9. The board of elections shall compile a list, arranged by election\ndistricts of residence, of the names and addresses of all voters whose\nregistration records have been moved pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection and the number of the election district to which such\nregistration record was moved. Not later than six days before election\nday, the board of elections shall send a copy of such list to the county\nchairman of each party. Such list shall be a public record at the office\nof such board of elections.\n  10.
