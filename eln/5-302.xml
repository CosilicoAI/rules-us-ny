          <p>  § 5-302. Enrollment; completion. 1. Before placing the registration\npoll record in the poll ledger or in the computer generated registration\nlist, the board shall enter in the space provided therefor the name of\nthe party designated by the voter on his application form, provided such\nparty continues to be a party as defined in this law. If such party\nceases to be a party at any time, either before or after such enrollment\nis so entered, the enrollment of such voter shall be deemed to be blank\nand shall be entered as such until such voter files an application for\nchange of enrollment pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The\nboard shall enter the date of such entry and affix initials thereto in\nthe space provided.\n  2. If the application form is for a voter who has changed his\nenrollment or a voter who has previously registered and not enrolled,\nthen the board of elections shall compare the information and the\nsignature appearing on each application form received with that on the\nregistration poll record of the applicant and if found to correspond in\nall particulars shall, not earlier than the Tuesday following the next\ngeneral election and not later than the thirtieth day preceding the last\nday for publishing enrollment lists, proceed in the manner specified in\nsubdivision one hereof to enter such enrollment on such voter's\nregistration poll card.\n  3. If marks are found in more than one of the boxes or circles or if\nno marks are found in any of the boxes or circles of any application\nform, the voter who used the application form shall be deemed not to be\nenrolled, and the words blank or void shall be entered in the space\nreserved on his registration poll record for the name of a political\nparty or in the computer files from which the computer generated\nregistration lists are prepared. However if such application form sets\nforth the address of prior registration and such prior registration had\nnot been previously cancelled, the party enrollment, if any, which is\npart of such prior registration shall be entered in such space on such\nregistration poll record or in such computer files.\n  4. Registration poll records of voters whose registrations are not\nrejected by the board of elections shall forthwith be placed in the poll\nledger or such voters' names shall forthwith be entered in the computer\nfiles from which the computer generated registration lists are prepared,\nexcept that the registration poll record of an otherwise qualified voter\nwho registers after the tenth day before a primary election shall not be\nplaced in such poll ledger or such voters' names shall not appear on\nsuch a computer generated registration list until after such primary and\nexcept further that the registration poll record of a voter whose\nprevious registration was cancelled pursuant to the provisions of this\nchapter after the previous general election and who registers pursuant\nto the provisions of this chapter after such cancellation shall not be\nplaced in such poll ledger or such voters' names shall not appear on\nsuch a computer generated registration list until after the fall primary\nelection, unless such voter has enrolled with the same party as the\nenrollment on the registration which was so cancelled.\n  The registration poll record of a voter who is not eligible to vote in\na primary election but who is eligible to vote in a special election\nheld before such primary election shall be placed in its regular place\nin the poll ledger or in a special section of such poll ledger for such\nspecial election as the board of elections, in its discretion, shall\nprovide, or such name shall appear in its regular place on the computer\ngenerated registration list prepared for use in such special election.\nSuch poll record shall be removed from such poll ledger or computer\ngenerated registration list immediately after such special election.\n  5. During the period preceding the ensuing primary election, the board\nof elections shall maintain as a public record a list of all enrollments\nentered, transferred or corrected, and not contained in the last\npublished enrollment list. Such supplemental enrollment list shall\ncontain the same information and shall be distributed in the same manner\nas the original enrollment list not later than the tenth day before the\nprimary election.\n</p>
