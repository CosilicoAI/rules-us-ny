The Supreme Court or a justice thereof within the\njudicial district, in a proceeding instituted by a duly enrolled voter\nof the party at least ten days before a primary election, shall direct\nthe enrollment of such voter to be cancelled if it appears from the\nproceedings before such person or sub-committee, and other proofs, if\nany, presented, that such determination is just.\n  3.
