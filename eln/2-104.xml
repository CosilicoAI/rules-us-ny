          <p>  § 2-104. County committee; creation. 1. The county committee of each\nparty shall be constituted by the election in each election district\nwithin such county of at least two members and of such additional\nmembers as the rules of the county committee of the party within the\ncounty or the statement filed pursuant hereto may provide for such\ndistrict, proportional to the party vote in the district for governor at\nthe last preceding gubernatorial election, or in case the boundaries of\nsuch district have been changed or a new district has been created since\nthe last preceding gubernatorial election, proportional to the party\nvote cast for member of assembly or in the event there was no election\nfor member of assembly, then proportional to the number of enrolled\nvoters of such party in such district on the list of enrolled voters\nlast published by the board of elections, excluding voters in inactive\nstatus. In a county in which no additional members are provided for by\nthe rules of the county committee or the statement filed pursuant hereto\nthe voting power of each member shall be in proportion to such party\nvote or, if the election district which such member represents was\ncreated or changed since the last election for member of assembly,\nproportional to such party enrollment. In a county in which additional\nmembers are so provided for, on the basis of the party vote or\nenrollment in election districts within such county, each member shall\nhave one vote. Each member of a county committee shall be an enrolled\nvoter of the party residing in the county and the assembly district from\nwhich or in the assembly district containing the election district in\nwhich such member is elected except that a member of a county committee\nwho, as a result of an alteration of assembly district lines, no longer\nresides within such assembly district may continue to serve for the\nbalance of the term to which he was elected.\n  2. If such committee or a state convention of the party shall provide\nby rule for representation by gender on such committee, the rules of\nsuch committee relative to additional members, either from election\ndistricts or at large, shall be formulated and applied in such manner\nthat the whole membership shall be divided among genders as provided by\nthe rules of such committee. When any such rule provides for such\nrepresentation, the designating petitions and primary ballots shall list\ncandidates for such party positions separately by gender marker. In\nproviding for such representation, such committee shall establish rules\nthat provide for the ability of individuals who do not exclusively\nidentify as a binary gender to serve as members and which respect\nindividuals' gender identity.\n  3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section,\na county committee of a party shall be legally constituted if\ntwenty-five per centum of the committeemen required to be elected in\nsuch county, as provided in subdivision one of this section, have been\nelected.\n</p>
