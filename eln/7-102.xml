Such number shall\nbe in arabic numerals and shall be placed at the beginning of each such\ncandidate's name. The board of elections with which the certificates or\npetitions of designation for such candidates are filed shall determine\nsuch numbers by lot not later than ten days after the last day to file\nsuch certificates or petitions upon at least five days written notice by\nfirst class mail to each such candidate.

In the event that a candidate in a primary election believes\nthat the name of another candidate for the same office or position at\nsuch election is sufficiently similar to his or hers so as to cause\nconfusion among the voters, such candidate may, not later than five days\nafter the last day to file the certificates or petitions of designation,\nfile with the board of elections with which such certificates or\npetitions of designation are filed, a request that such board determine\nthat such a sufficient similarity exists.\n  b.

Such number shall be in arabic numerals and\nshall be placed at the beginning of each such candidate's name.\n  4. a. If such board assigns numbers to candidates' names pursuant to\nthe provisions of subdivision two or three of this section it shall also\nprepare for distribution at such election, a leaflet which contains\nbiographical information on each such candidate, on one side of a single\nsheet of paper in the order of the numbers it has assigned to such\ncandidates.

If such board determines that\nsuch filing does not comply with the requirements of this subdivision,\nit shall notify such candidate forthwith by first class mail. Such\ncandidate may file revised information with such board not later than\nten days after such notice was mailed.
