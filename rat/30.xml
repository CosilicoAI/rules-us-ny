The board of transportation shall also be empowered to purchase\nall necessary materials and supplies for such operation and maintenance,\nand, generally, to exercise all requisite and necessary authority to\nmanage and direct the operation and maintenance of such road for the\nconvenience and safety of the public, provided, however, that, except as\notherwise provided in section seventeen of this chapter, any contract\nfor the purchase of such materials and supplies or work or labor to be\nperformed, the estimated cost of which exceeds the sum of twenty-five\nhundred dollars shall be made by the said board only upon public letting\nfounded on sealed bids, except in a case where the board, by resolution,\ndeclares the existence of an emergency or the existence of other\ncircumstances making competitive bidding impracticable. Notice of the\ninvitation for such bidding stating the date and place of the receipt\nand opening of bids shall be published in the city record in five\nsuccessive issues immediately preceding such opening. The board may\nreject all such bids and readvertise for new bids if it shall deem it\nfor the public interest so to do; if not, it shall award the contract to\nthe lowest responsible bidder unless the board, by unanimous vote, shall\ndetermine that it is for the public interest that a bid other than that\nof the lowest responsible bidder shall be accepted.\n</p>
