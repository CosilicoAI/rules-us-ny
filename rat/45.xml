          <p>  § 45. Extensions and additional lines. a. Whenever the board of\ntransportation shall determine that the public interests so require, it\nmay with the approval of the board of estimate and the mayor, without\nadvertising for proposals, but only after a public hearing under section\nthirty-four of this chapter, enter into a contract with the person\nowning, operating or agreeing to operate, any existing railroad for the\nconstruction, equipment, maintenance and operation, or for the\nequipment, maintenance and operation of any additional or proposed\nrailroad to be owned by the city for which necessary consents as\nprovided in section twenty-one of this chapter shall have been obtained,\nprovided that such proposed railroad shall be operated in conjunction\nwith such existing railroad for a single fare. Such contract for the\nequipment, maintenance and operation of such road or any portion thereof\nmay be made and entered into before consents shall have been obtained\ntherefor as provided in section twenty-one of this chapter. In such case\nsuch contract for equipment, maintenance and operation of such road or\nany portion thereof shall be upon condition that such contract shall not\nbecome operative or go into effect as to such road or such portion\nthereof unless and until the city shall acquire the right to construct\nsuch road or portion thereof by obtaining such consents.\n  b. Such contract for construction, equipment, maintenance and\noperation or for equipment, maintenance and operation may be made in\neither of the two following ways:\n  1.

Every such contract for such construction, equipment, maintenance\nand operation or for such equipment, maintenance and operation of such\nproposed railroad made in either of the foregoing specified ways, shall\nalso make provision that the city, upon giving a specified notice, may\nterminate the contract for equipment, maintenance and operation of any\nsuch proposed railroad as to all and if deemed advisable as to any\nspecified portion thereof at any time after the expiration of ten years\nfrom the date when operation of any part of such proposed railroad or of\nsuch specified portion thereof shall actually begin, but such right of\ntermination of any such contract shall be upon condition as follows:\n  1.

In case the title to the\nequipment of such proposed railroad shall be vested in the city then\nthat the city shall pay to the contractor an amount for his investment\nin the equipment of such proposed railroad, or portion thereof, which\nshall not exceed the actual cost to the contractor of equipment of such\nrailroad or portion, plus fifteen per centum thereof, and shall decrease\nunder provisions of the contract as the term thereof continues so that\nat the end of the full term of the contract no such amount shall be paid\nexcept that if additional equipment shall be required and supplied after\nthe railroad, or portion thereof, shall have been put in operation, and\nif the contract shall provide that title to such additional equipment\nshall vest in the city when supplied, then the city shall pay an amount\nfor the investment of the contractor in such additional equipment which\namount shall not exceed the actual cost to the contractor of such\nadditional equipment plus fifteen percentum thereof and shall diminish\nso that at the end of the full term of the contract the city shall be\nrequired to pay for such investment in additional equipment only such\namount as shall be provided in such contract.\n  2.
