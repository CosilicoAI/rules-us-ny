          <p>  § 52. Maps and plans to be filed.  The board of transportation shall\ncause three similar maps or plans to be made of each parcel of property\nwhich it may deem necessary so to be acquired, or to which there may be\nappurtenant property rights necessary so to be acquired or extinguished,\ndesignating each of such parcels by a number. Upon each map or plan so\nmade or in a memorandum accompanying it and to be deemed part thereof\nsuch board shall cause to be clearly indicated the particular property\nrights to be acquired or extinguished for the purposes of this chapter,\ntogether with the assessed valuation of the fee on the tax rolls of the\ncity for each of the three years preceding the date of the approval and\nadoption of such map or plan by such board, in relation to each and\nevery piece or parcel of property described upon such map or plan. Such\nboard shall have power to cause a triplicate set of maps or plans and\nmemoranda as herein provided for to be made as often and at such times\nas they shall determine, and each set of maps or plans and memoranda so\nmade shall contain the particulars above enumerated within such district\nas such board shall in each case provide. The maps or plans and\nmemoranda provided for by this section, when approved and adopted by\nsuch board, shall have written thereon a certificate of such approval,\nsigned by the members of the board adopting and approving it, and one\ncopy thereof shall be filed in the office of the president of the\nborough, there to remain as a public record, and the other two sets of\nmaps or plans and memoranda shall be transmitted to the corporation\ncounsel. Such board, from time to time, may make and file further maps\nor plans and memoranda amending those already filed, but not so as to\ndefeat or impair any property or interest which shall have been already\nacquired, or to revive any property right which may have been already\nextinguished by the city.\n</p>
