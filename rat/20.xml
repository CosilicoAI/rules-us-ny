Upon the request in writing of the board of\nestimate at any time, such board of transportation shall proceed\nforthwith to consider and determine such questions, and in each case\nsuch board of transportation shall conduct such an inquest and\ninvestigation as may be deemed necessary in the premises. If, after any\nsuch consideration and inquest, such board of transportation shall\ndetermine that a railroad, in addition to any already existing,\nauthorized or proposed, or any extension, modification or change of the\nroute or method of transportation of any previously established railroad\nthat may be or is owned by such city by virtue of the provisions of any\nlaw, are necessary for the interest of the public and such city, it\nshall proceed to determine and establish the route thereof and the\ngeneral plan of construction.
