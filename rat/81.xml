          <p>  § 81. Connection with other railroads or transit facilities.  a. The\ncommission, from time to time, with the approval of the board of\nestimate and the mayor, upon application of any person owning, leasing,\nconstructing or actually operating or having the right by contract to\nthereafter operate a railroad wholly or in part within the limits of the\ncity, if in the judgment of such commission, the public interests so\ndemand, may also fix and determine the route by which any such person\nmay connect with other railroads, or the stations thereof, or with\nferries or bridges, or may extend any line which he operates or has the\nright to operate as aforesaid within such city, or upon the application\nof a corporation organized under the railroad law for any of the\npurposes specified in subdivision 1 of section forty of this chapter,\nand agreeing to equip, maintain and operate or to procure to be\nequipped, maintained and operated, any road of the city in connection\nwith any existing railroad of a railroad corporation and any extension\nthereof wholly within such city, on the basis of a division of income,\nearnings or profits as herein provided, the commission with like\napproval, if in its judgment the public interests so demand, may fix and\ndetermine the route by which such person may construct, maintain and\noperate such extension, and with like approval, may authorize such\nperson to construct, maintain and operate any such extension, and may\nwith like approval authorize any such person to lay an additional track\non, above, under or contiguous to a portion or the whole of the route of\nhis railroad within such city and to acquire terminal or other\nfacilities necessary for the accommodation of the traveling public on\nany street except the place known as Battery Park on which such railroad\nshall be located.  The commission, with like approval, may also\nauthorize any such person to lay his tracks and operate his railroad to\nany terminal within such city, and to transport thereover passengers or\nfreight or both, and to run either passenger trains or freight trains or\nmixed trains thereover.  The commission, with like approval, shall fix\nand determine the locations and plans of construction of the railroads\nupon such facilities, the times within which they shall be respectively\nconstructed, the compensation to be made therefor to the city by such\nperson, and such other terms, conditions and requirements as to such\ncommission and board of estimate with the approval of the mayor may\nappear just and proper.  Every such determination, authorization and\nlicense shall be made upon the condition that such person, from the time\nof the commencement of the operation of any such railroad under such\ndetermination, authorization or license, shall annually pay to such city\na sum or rental which may be a part or proportion of gross or net\nreceipts, and that the amount of such sum or rental for a period of not\nmore than twenty-five years, beginning with such operation of any such\nrailroad shall be prescribed by the commission in such determination,\nauthorization and license, and that every such determination,\nauthorization and license shall provide for the readjustment of the\namount of such sum or rental at the expiration of the period for which\nit shall be so prescribed and for readjustment from time to time in the\nfuture, to the end of the period of renewal, if any, of the amount of\nsuch annual payment at intervals each of not more than twenty years.\nSuch determination, authorization or license may provide that for the\nwhole or any portion of the life of the grant in lieu of such annual\nrental the gross or net receipts derived from the operation of such\nrailroad owned, operated or to be operated by such person within the\nlimits of such city, and from the operation of such connecting or\nextending facilities may be combined, and that the city may receive as\nsuch compensation at intervals named a specified part or proportion of\nthe income, earnings or profits of the railroad, and the facilities\nwhose receipts are so combined or of those and any other railroads which\nmay be operated in connection therewith in like manner, which part or\nproportion may be deferred to a previous distribution to such person,\nwhich distribution may be cumulative. In such case such determination,\nauthorization or license may apportion out of the amount so to be\nreceived by the city and shall specify a portion thereof which shall be\ndeemed to be the rental for the use of such facilities. Such\ndetermination, authorization or license shall also provide for\ndetermining the amount of the income, earnings or profits of the\nrailroad within the limits of the city and of the facilities whose\nreceipts are so combined. It may also provide for readjustment of the\nproportion which the city shall receive or of the portion thereof which\nshall be deemed to be the rental for the use of such facilities at\nspecified intervals. In addition, it may prescribe a method of\ndetermining by arbitration or by the court the amount which the city\nshall receive as its proportion of such income, earnings or profits or\nas such rental upon any such readjustment thereof. Such determination,\nauthorization or license shall contain a reservation to the city of the\nprivilege, upon giving a specified notice, to terminate the franchise,\nright or authority granted under this section as to all, and, if deemed\nadvisable, as to any specified portion of such facilities, and to\npurchase and take the plant and property as defined in the grant at any\ntime after the expiration of ten years from the date when operation of\nany part of such facilities or of such specified portion thereof shall\nactually begin, upon paying an amount for such plant and property as\nproperty, excluding any value for the franchise, right or authority,\nwhich amount shall not exceed actual cost as defined in the grant of\nsuch plant and property plus fifteen per centum thereof.  Such amount\nshall decrease under provisions of the grant as the franchise continues,\nso that at the end of the full term of the grant or at the end of a\nperiod specified therein, no amount shall be paid except for\nbetterments, additions, improvements and additional equipment as\nhereinafter provided. The grant shall provide a method of ascertaining\nthe amount to be paid for such plant and property on termination by the\ncity of such franchise, right or authority and for the betterments,\nadditions, improvements and additional equipment at the end of the full\nterm of the grant. The grant may provide for determining, from time to\ntime in default of agreement by arbitration or by the court, a valuation\nof such plant and property or any part or portion thereof for any\npurpose under such grant. Such determination, authorization or license\nmay also make suitable provision to the end that if the city, after so\nterminating such franchise, right or authority or at the end of the full\nterm of the grant shall propose to give a new franchise, right or\nauthority in the enjoyment of which such plant and property or any part\nthereof may be utilized, the title to and possession of such plant and\nproperty or any part thereof may be transferred directly to the grantee\nof any such new franchise, right or authority when such new grantee\nshall pay the amount so required. In the case of additional track added\nto any elevated rapid transit railroad, however, the determination,\nauthorization or license may provide that such privilege of the city to\nterminate the franchise, right or authority therefor and to purchase and\ntake the plant and property shall not be for railroad transit operation\neither by the city or by any other party, and shall be without prejudice\nto the rights of such person in the lines of such existing elevated\nrailroad, and may make adequate provision for the protection of such\nrights. The commission, with like approval may authorize the re-location\nof any devices and appurtenances of such person in any street in which\nthey exist, any such re-located structure to be held under all the terms\nand privileges of the original franchise.\n  b. A certificate shall be prepared by the commission, attested by its\nseal and the signature of its presiding officer, setting forth in detail\nthe action taken by the commission with respect to such connecting or\nextended facilities, and the terms, conditions and requirements\naforesaid, including provisions as to such annual payments and the\nfuture readjustments thereof. A like certificate shall be prepared in\nlike manner upon every modification of the terms of the contract as\nprovided in this chapter. Every such certificate shall prescribe the\nterms and conditions of the readjustments of such annual payments and\nmay provide for the determination of such amount upon such readjustments\nby arbitration or by the supreme court. Such certificate shall be\ndelivered to such person upon the receipt by such commission of a\nwritten acceptance of such terms, conditions and requirements, duly\nexecuted by such person so as to entitle it to be recorded.\n  c. Such certificate shall be filed in the office of the secretary of\nstate, and a duly certified copy thereof shall be filed in the office of\nthe clerk of each county to which such privileges granted hereunder\npertain, and thereupon, and upon fulfillment, by such person so far as\nit relates to such facilities, of such of the requirements and\nconditions as are necessary to be fulfilled in such cases, under section\nseventeen of article three of the constitution. Upon fulfillment by such\nperson of such other terms, conditions and requirements enumerated in\nsuch certificate, as the commission may require to be fulfilled as a\ncondition precedent to commencing such work, such person shall in such\ncases possess in addition to existing franchises all the powers\nconferred by this</p>
