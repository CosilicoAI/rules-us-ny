Whenever the attorney general shall believe from evidence\nsatisfactory to him that any person, firm, corporation or association or\nagent or employee thereof has violated any provision of this section, he\nmay bring an action in the supreme court of the state of New York for a\njudgment enjoining the continuance of such violation and for a civil\npenalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation, except\nthat the court may impose a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand\ndollars if the violation is knowing and willful. If it shall appear to\nthe satisfaction of the court or justice that the defendant has violated\nany provision of this section, no proof shall be required that any\nperson has been injured thereby nor that the defendant knowingly or\nintentionally violated such provision. In such action preliminary relief\nmay be granted under article sixty-three of the civil practice law and\nrules. Before any violation of this section is sought to be enjoined,\nthe attorney general shall be required to give the person against whom\nsuch proceeding is contemplated notice by certified mail and an\nopportunity to show in writing within five business days after receipt\nof notice why proceedings should not be instituted against him, unless\nthe attorney general shall find, in any case in which he seeks\npreliminary relief, that to give such notice and opportunity is not in\nthe public interest.\n  * NB There are 3 § 399-dd's\n</p>
