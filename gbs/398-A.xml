Upon\nreceipt of such document, said person shall determine that the motor\nvehicle to be transported outside the continental United States is the\nsame vehicle described in such proof of ownership and shall certify such\nfact upon the copy of the shipping order, dock receipt, bill of lading\nor other export paper for such vehicle which he retains for his records.\nThe person who prepares such export papers for the transportation of a\nmotor vehicle outside the continental United States shall maintain on\nfile for a period of three years the photocopy or other facsimile of\nsuch transfer of registration or other proof of ownership together with\nthe appropriate shipping order, dock receipt, bill of lading or other\nexport paper.  This section shall not apply to a motor vehicle which the\nmanufacturer thereof or a duly authorized dealer has never sold to a\npurchaser for the purpose of use rather than of resale.\n  2.
