If the retail lease agreement provides that the lessee shall be\nresponsible upon a total loss of the goods occasioned by theft or\nphysical damage for the gap amount, the lessor, prior to the execution\nof the agreement, shall offer to waive its contractual right to hold the\nlessee liable for the gap amount in the event of a total loss of the\ngoods occasioned by theft or physical damage, only if non-motor vehicle\nlessor gap insurance coverage is available to the lessor or the\nanticipated assignee and such coverage is obtained from a\nproperty/casualty insurance company, which has been licensed by the\nsuperintendent of financial services of this state to write non-motor\nvehicle lessor gap insurance in this state. This offer may be made\ncontingent upon the payment by the lessee of a separate charge that\nshall not exceed the cost of lessor gap insurance covering the retail\nlease transaction plus an administrative fee not to exceed ten dollars.\nNothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize a\nwaiver, in connection with a transaction with respect to which lessor\ngap insurance has not been obtained, of a contractual right to hold the\nlessee liable for the gap amount in the event of a total loss of the\ngoods occasioned by theft or physical damage.\n  3.
