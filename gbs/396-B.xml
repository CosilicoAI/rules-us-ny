            <p>"Artificial intelligence", "artificial intelligence technology",\nor "AI" means a machine-based system that can, for a given set of\nhuman-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or\ndecisions influencing real or virtual environments, and that uses\nmachine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual\nenvironments, abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in\nan automated manner, and use model inference to formulate options for\ninformation or action. This definition includes but is not limited to\nsystems that use machine learning, large language model, natural\nlanguage processing, and computer vision technologies, including\ngenerative artificial intelligence.\n</p>
