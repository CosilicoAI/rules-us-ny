            <p>In promulgating such regulations, the attorney general shall\nconsider the size, financial resources, and technical capabilities of\nthe addictive social media platform, the costs and effectiveness of\navailable age determination techniques for users of the addictive social\nmedia platform, the audience of the addictive social media platform,\nprevalent practices of the industry of the covered operator, and the\nimpact of the age determination techniques on the covered users' safety,\nutility, and experience.\n</p>

Such regulations shall set forth multiple\ncommercially reasonable and technically feasible methods for a covered\noperator to determine if a covered user is a covered minor, including at\nleast one method that either does not rely solely on government issued\nidentification or that allows a covered user to maintain anonymity as to\nthe covered operator of the addictive social media platform.\n</p>
