"Artificial intelligence" means a machine-based system that can,\nfor a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions,\nrecommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments,\nand that uses machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and\nvirtual environments, abstract such perceptions into models through\nanalysis in an automated manner, and use model inference to formulate\noptions for information or action.\n  3. "Artificial intelligence model" means an information system or\ncomponent of an information system that implements artificial\nintelligence technology and uses computational, statistical, or\nmachine-learning techniques to produce outputs from a given set of\ninputs.\n  4. "Compute cost" means the cost incurred to pay for compute used in\nthe final training run of a model when calculated using the average\npublished market prices of cloud compute in the United States at the\nstart of training such model as reasonably assessed by the person doing\nthe training.\n  5. "Deploy" means to use a frontier model or to make a frontier model\nforeseeably available to one or more third parties for use,\nmodification, copying, or a combination thereof with other software,\nexcept for training or developing the frontier model, evaluating the\nfrontier model or other frontier models, or complying with federal or\nstate laws.\n  6.

"Critical harm" means the death or serious injury of one hundred or\nmore people or at least one billion dollars of damages to rights in\nmoney or property caused or materially enabled by a large developer's\nuse, storage, or release of a frontier model, through either of the\nfollowing:\n</p>

"Knowledge distillation" means any supervised learning technique\nthat uses a larger artificial intelligence model or the output of a\nlarger artificial intelligence model to train a smaller artificial\nintelligence model with similar or equivalent capabilities as the larger\nartificial intelligence model.\n  9. "Large developer" means a person that has trained at least one\nfrontier model and has spent over one hundred million dollars in compute\ncosts in aggregate in training frontier models. Accredited colleges and\nuniversities shall not be considered large developers under this article\nto the extent that such colleges and universities are engaging in\nacademic research. If a person subsequently transfers full intellectual\nproperty rights of the frontier model to another person (including the\nright to resell the model) and retains none of those rights for\nthemself, then the receiving person shall be considered the large\ndeveloper and shall be subject to the responsibilities and requirements\nof this article after such transfer.\n  10. "Model weight" means a numerical parameter in an artificial\nintelligence model that is adjusted through training and that helps\ndetermine how inputs are transformed into outputs.\n  11.
