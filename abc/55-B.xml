It is hereby declared as the policy of the state that the\nsale and distribution of beer shall be subject to certain restrictions,\nprohibitions and regulations which tend to maintain an orderly market\nand prevent destructive competition. The necessity of the provisions of\nthis section is therefore declared as a matter of legislative necessity.\n  2. No brewer or beer wholesaler may increase the price per case, draft\npackage or special package of beer sold to beer wholesalers or retail\nlicensees until at least one hundred eighty days have elapsed since his\nlast price decrease on such case, draft package or special package,\nprovided, however, that the brewer or beer wholesaler may increase any\nprice established by him at any time in the amount of any direct tax\nincrease on beer or three percent of the final cash invoice amount to\nreasonably remunerate such wholesaler for surcharges and fees incurred\nfor business payment card payments, as provided for by paragraph j of\nsubdivision one of section one hundred one-aaa of this chapter, or on\ncontainers thereof, actually paid by such brewer or beer wholesaler, and\nprovided further, however, that if a brewer or beer wholesaler has\nincreased his price to beer wholesalers at any time pursuant to the\nprovisions hereof, the beer wholesaler may increase the price\nestablished by him on such package in an amount equal to the direct\nprice increase to the beer wholesaler. The price per case, draft package\nor special package of beer sold to beer wholesalers or retail licensees\non the first day of the month following the effective date of this act\nshall be deemed the base price, to or from which price increases or\ndecreases may be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n  3. The authority is authorized and empowered to do such acts,\nprescribe such forms and adopt rules and regulations as it may deem\nnecessary or proper to carry into effect the purpose and provisions of\nthis section and to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof.\n  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and in addition to\nits other powers, the authority may, in its discretion, adopt rules or\nregulations:\n  a.

Providing that for good cause shown to its satisfaction, the\nauthority may grant waivers to licensees adversely affected by this\nsection, under such terms and conditions as the authority deems\nappropriate.\n  d.
