Every member\nshall pay one hundred dollars for each share of the capital of the\nsavings and loan bank issued to it.\n  2. Members of the savings and loan bank shall not be individually\nliable for the payment of its debts.\n  3. Shares shall not be transferable, except that a member, which is\nnot liable to the savings and loan bank for any direct obligation may\ntransfer its shares therein to another savings and loan association, by\nand with the consent of the board of directors of the savings and loan\nbank; or it may retire from membership and receive back such sums as it\nhas paid for its shares, upon giving one year's notice in writing to the\nsavings and loan bank of such intention, provided, however, that no\nwithdrawal shall be permitted by the board of directors, which shall\nreduce the total amount of the capital of the savings and loan bank\nbelow five hundred thousand dollars.
