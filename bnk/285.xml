To buy any assets owned by any member bank at the book value\nthereof notwithstanding such value may exceed the market value thereof,\nor such other value as the trustee may elect either with or without an\nagreement providing for the repurchase of the same at such price or\nvalue and at such time and subject to such conditions as may be agreed\nupon by the trustee in its discretion and to make loans or advances to\nany member bank upon such terms and conditions as may seem desirable and\nwith such security as the trustee may determine or without security; in\nany agreement of repurchase or repayment it may be provided that the\nsavings bank receiving such loan or advance or making such sale of\nassets may not be obligated to repay the same or repurchase such assets\nuntil the superintendent of financial services shall certify that such\nsavings bank is in a safe and sound condition to make such repurchase or\nrepayment.\n  3.

The agreement may provide the\nmanner in which the surplus and surplus fund shall be computed for the\npurpose of this subdivision. Such contributions shall not constitute a\nliability of such member bank except as herein provided.\n  6.
