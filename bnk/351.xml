Interest, consideration, or charges for the use of money shall not\nbe deducted or received in advance and shall be computed on unpaid\nprincipal balances.

When a closed-end loan agreement requires repayment in\nsubstantially equal and consecutive monthly installments of principal\nand interest combined, the interest may be precomputed at the agreed\nrate on scheduled unpaid principal balances according to the terms of\nthe agreement and added to the principal amount of the loan.

The deferment period is\nthat period in which no scheduled payment has been made and in which no\npayment is required by reason of the deferment.
