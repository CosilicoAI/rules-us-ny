The term\n"subprime home loan" excludes a transaction to finance the initial\nconstruction of a dwelling, i.e., a construction only loan, a temporary\nor "bridge" loan with a term of twelve months or less, such as a loan to\npurchase a new dwelling where the borrower plans to sell a current\ndwelling within twelve months, or a home equity line of credit but shall\ninclude any loan, however structured, that thereafter is converted into\na permanent loan.\n</p>
