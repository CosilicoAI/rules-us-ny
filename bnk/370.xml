Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this subdivision, a licensee may relocate from any location\nto a location that is within three-tenths of a mile from another\nlicensee with the written consent of the other licensee. If the\nsuperintendent approves such application he or she shall issue a new\nlicense in duplicate in accordance with the provisions of section three\nhundred sixty-nine of this article, stating the new location of such\nlicensee or, in the case of a mobile unit, the new area in which such\nmobile unit may be operated.\n</p>
