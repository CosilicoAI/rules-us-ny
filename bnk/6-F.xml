            <p>of\nthis subdivision, subject to the provisions of subdivision two of this\nsection. Where the lender or holder of a residential mortgage loan or\ncooperative apartment unit loan enters into a written agreement with the\nborrower under which the lender or holder conditionally reduces an\namount of principal of such loan in order to assist a borrower at risk\nof foreclosure to avoid such foreclosure, the lender or holder may enter\ninto a written agreement (a "shared appreciation agreement") with the\nborrower under which the lender shall be entitled to share in the\nappreciation of the market value of the real property or cooperative\nshares and proprietary lease securing such loan between the effective\ndate of such reduction in principal amount until the date when the\nproperty is sold, provided that the amount the lender is entitled to\nreceive under such shared appreciation agreement shall be the lesser of\n</p>

            <p>the amount of such reduction in principal, plus interest on such\namount from the date of such reduction to the date of payment at the\nsame rate of interest as applies to the remaining principal amount of\nthe residential mortgage loan, and (ii) fifty percent of the amount of\nsuch appreciation. Such amounts shall be payable when the mortgagor\nsells the residential real property or cooperative shares and\nproprietary lease that secure the loan. Such shared appreciation\nagreement shall expressly and conspicuously bear a legend at the top of\nthe agreement in at least fourteen-point type which shall include the\nfollowing: "In this agreement, you are giving away some of any future\nincrease in value of your home. Please read carefully." For purposes of\nthis subdivision, the appreciation of the property shall be measured as\nthe difference, if positive, between the gross sales proceeds (net of\nany reasonable real estate commission) of the sale of the property and\nthe value of the property at the time of the closing of the shared\nappreciation mortgage, as determined by an appraisal by an independent\nNew York state licensed real estate appraiser. Recovery of such\nreduction in the principal amount shall not be deemed to be interest for\nany purpose of the laws of this state.\n  Any shared appreciation agreement shall be accompanied by a notice,\nwhich shall be on a separate page from the shared appreciation agreement\nand shall contain the following heading in bold, fourteen-point type:\n"Important disclosures about the contract in which you agree to give\naway a part of any future increase in value of your home. Please read\ncarefully." The notice shall include the following disclosures:\n</p>
