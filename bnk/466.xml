Every member entitled to vote at a meeting of members\nof the credit union may authorize another person or persons to act for\nhim by proxy at such meeting or, if the bylaws so provide, may vote by\nmail in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws. Every proxy must\nbe signed by the member or his attorney-in-fact.  No proxy shall be\nvalid except for the meeting specified therein and adjournments thereof.\nEvery proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the member executing\nit.

A shareholder may vote by proxy at a meeting called to vote\nupon voluntary dissolution. The bylaws may prohibit or further limit\nproxies for members and their duration.
