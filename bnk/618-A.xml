            <p>the repudiation of which the superintendent\ndetermines, in the superintendent's discretion, will promote the orderly\nadministration of the banking organization's affairs. After the\nexpiration of ninety days from the date that the superintendent takes\npossession of the banking organization, any party to a contract with the\nbanking organization being liquidated may demand in writing that the\nsuperintendent assume or repudiate such contract. If the superintendent\nhas not assumed or repudiated the contract within fifteen calendar days\nfrom the date of receipt of the demand by the superintendent, the\naffected party may bring an action in the supreme court in the judicial\ndistrict in which the principal office of the banking organization is\nlocated to obtain an order requiring the superintendent to decide\nwhether to assume or repudiate that contract.  If the superintendent has\nnot assumed or repudiated a contract by one month before the last date\nfor filing claims against the banking organization being liquidated\npursuant to section six hundred twenty of this article, such contract\nshall be deemed repudiated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect\nto an unexpired lease of the banking organization for the rental of real\nproperty under which the banking organization was a lessee, if the\nsuperintendent remains in possession of the leasehold, the\nsuperintendent shall not be required to assume or repudiate such lease\nand may continue in possession of such leasehold for the remainder of\nthe term of the lease in accordance with the terms of the lease;\nprovided, however, that should the superintendent later repudiate the\nlease before the end of the lease term, any amounts that may be due the\nlessor due to such repudiation shall be calculated according to the\nprovisions of paragraph</p>
