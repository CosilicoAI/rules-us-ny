The balconies shall have a width of at least four\nfeet throughout their length and shall have a landing not less than\ntwenty-four inches square at the head of every stairway.  There shall be\na passageway between the stairway opening and the side of the building\nat least eighteen inches wide throughout except where the stairways\nreach and leave the balconies at the ends or where double run stairways\nare used.
