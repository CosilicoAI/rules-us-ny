            <p>Whenever a claimant's base period includes a completed calendar\nquarter for which a wage data report is not due or has not been received\nand the claimant provides information as required by the commissioner,\nthe commissioner shall determine such claimant's entitlement and benefit\nrate using the information the claimant provided for such quarter.\nHowever, in those instances where the claimant is unable to provide such\ninformation to the commissioner's satisfaction, the commissioner may\nrequest the employer to provide the amount of remuneration paid to such\nindividual. The commissioner shall notify each base period employer upon\nthe establishment of a valid original claim, of such claim. If an\nemployer provides new or corrected information in response to the\ninitial notice of monetary entitlement, adjustments to the claimant's\nbenefit rate and adjustments to the employer's experience rating account\nshall be prospective as of the date such information was received by the\ndepartment.\n</p>

Limitation on review of determinations. Any determination regarding\na benefit claim may, in the absence of fraud or wilful\nmisrepresentation, be reviewed only within one year from the date it is\nissued because of new or corrected information, or, if the review is\nbased thereon, within six months from a retroactive payment of\nremuneration, provided that no decision on the merits of the case has\nbeen made upon hearing or appeal.
