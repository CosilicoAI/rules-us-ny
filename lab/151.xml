THE CHILD'S\nPARENTS OR GUARDIAN MUST PROVIDE THE CHILD PERFORMER'S EMPLOYER WITH THE\nINFORMATION NECESSARY TO TRANSFER THESE MONIES TO THE ACCOUNT.

            <p>of this subdivision\nshall not apply to the issuance of an employer's certificate of\neligibility or to a child performer covered by an employer's certificate\nof eligibility who subsequently seeks to obtain an initial individual\npermit to work.\n  5. Failure to produce any permit or certificate either to work or to\nemploy is prima facie evidence of the illegal employment of any child\nperformer whose permit or certificate is not produced. Proof that any\nperson was the manager or superintendent of any place of employment\nsubject to the provisions of this article at the time any child\nperformer is alleged to have been employed therein in violation thereof,\nis prima facie evidence that the person employed or permitted the child\nperformer to work. The sworn statement of the commissioner, or his or\nher deputy or agents, as to the age of any child performer affected by\nthis article is prima facie evidence of the age of such child.\n</p>
