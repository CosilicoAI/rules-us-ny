A board of inquiry shall,\nafter investigation, make a final report to the commissioner as to the\nmatters referred to it and may make interim reports. Unless the strike,\nlock-out or other industrial dispute is terminated or adjusted prior\nthereto, or is re-submitted by all parties to the dispute for voluntary\nsettlement to the state board of mediation, any final report of a board\nof inquiry shall be made public by the commissioner. The commissioner\nmay make public any interim report of a board of inquiry or any part\nthereof, in such manner as he deems proper. Provided, however, that\nthere shall be excluded from any report or publication authorized by the\nboard or the commissioner, any information, other than information\nhaving a direct bearing on the dispute, obtained by the board in the\ncourse of its inquiry as to any labor union or as to any individual\nbusiness (whether carried on by person, firm or corporation) if at the\ntime such information is supplied to the board the person who supplies\nit represents to the board that it is confidential information and the\nboard is satisfied that it is information which is not available\notherwise than through evidence given at the inquiry, unless with\nrespect to such evidence so presented as confidential and found to be\nnot otherwise available the board procures from the labor union or the\nperson, firm or corporation the consent to publication; nor shall any\nindividual member of the board or any person concerned in the inquiry,\nwithout such consent, disclose any such information.\n</p>
