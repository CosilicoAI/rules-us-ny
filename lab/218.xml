            <p>In addition and as an alternative to any other remedy provided by\nthis section and provided that no proceeding for administrative or\njudicial review as provided in this chapter shall then be pending and\nthe time for initiation of such proceeding shall have expired, the\ncommissioner may issue a warrant under the commissioner's official seal,\ndirected to the sheriff of any county, commanding the sheriff to levy\nupon and sell the real and personal property that may be found within\nthe sheriff's county of an employer who has defaulted in the payment of\nany sum determined to be due from such employer for the payment of such\nsum together with interest, penalties, and the cost of executing the\nwarrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner and to pay into\nthe fund the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after\nthe receipt of such warrant. The sheriff shall, within five days after\nthe receipt of the warrant, file with the clerk of the county a copy\nthereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the\nname of the employer mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the\ncontribution, interest, and penalties for which the warrant is issued\nand the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such\nwarrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest\nin real property and chattels of the employer against whom the warrant\nis issued in the same manner as a judgment duly docketed in the office\nof such clerk. The sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the\nsame manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to\nexecutions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record,\nand the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which they may\ncollect in the same manner, for the sheriff's services in executing the\nwarrant.\n</p>

            <p>In the discretion of the commissioner, a warrant of like terms,\nforce, and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee\nof the department of labor who may file a copy of such warrant with the\nclerk of any county in the state, and thereupon each such clerk shall\ndocket it and it shall become a lien in the same manner and with the\nsame force and effect as hereinbefore provided with respect to a warrant\nissued and directed to and filed by a sheriff; and in the execution\nthereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by\nlaw upon sheriffs, but they shall be entitled to no fee or compensation\nin excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.\nIf a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner shall\nhave the same remedies to enforce the amount thereof as if the\ncommissioner had recovered judgment for the same.\n  4. The civil penalty provided for in this section shall be in addition\nto and may be imposed concurrently with any other remedy or penalty\nprovided for in this chapter.\n  5. An employer similar in operation and ownership to a prior employer\nwhich had been found in violation of article six, nineteen or nineteen-A\nof this chapter, shall be deemed the same employer for the purposes of\nthis section if the employees of the new employer are engaged in\nsubstantially the same work in substantially the same working conditions\nunder substantially the same supervisors, or if the subsequent employer\nhas substantially the same production process, produces substantially\nthe same products and has substantially the same body of customers. Such\nsubsequent employer shall continue to be subject to this section and\nliable for the acts of the prior employer under this section.\n</p>
