The contractor or subcontractor shall pay a non-refundable\nregistration fee of two hundred dollars to the commissioner which shall\nbe paid to the general fund. The commissioner, through regulations,\nshall reduce the registration fee associated with minority or\nwomen-owned business enterprises in order to promote the use of such\nbusinesses on covered projects.\n  4. Unless the commissioner determines a contractor or subcontractor\nunfit to be registered, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of\nregistration to the contractor or subcontractor upon receipt of the fee,\nform and documentation required by this section. A registration\ncertificate shall be valid for two calendar years from the date of\nregistration. Registrations may be renewed not less than ninety days\nbefore the expiration date of the immediately preceding registration.\nThe commissioner shall promulgate regulations to determine under what\ncircumstances a contractor or subcontractor would be unfit to be\nregistered pursuant to this section; provided that a contractor or\nsubcontractor shall not be determined to be unfit solely because a\ncontractor or subcontractor was debarred within the last eight years,\nunless such contractor or subcontractor is currently debarred or\nineligible pursuant to subdivision three of section two hundred twenty-b\nof this article or section one hundred forty-one-b of the workers'\ncompensation law or such contractor or subcontractor is subject to a\nfinal administrative or court order for violation of state or federal\nprevailing wage law which has not been fully satisfied, provided further\nthat a contractor that has made payment for unpaid wages on behalf of a\nsubcontractor shall not be determined unfit solely as a result of\nactions of a subcontractor.

Such notice shall notify the contractor or\nsubcontractor that a request for a hearing must be made within thirty\ndays after issuance of such notification. If a hearing is requested,\nsuch hearing shall be held at such time and place as the commissioner\nshall prescribe. If the contractor or subcontractor fails to make a\nwritten request for a hearing within thirty days after issuance of such\nnotification, then the notification of determination shall become the\nfinal determination of the commissioner. Any documents, reports, or\ninformation that form a basis for such determination shall be provided\nto the contractor or subcontractor no less than ten days before the\nhearing. For purposes of this subdivision, the term "unfit" shall mean a\ncontractor or subcontractor who the commissioner determines to be unable\nto lawfully adhere to contractual obligations of this article and\nresponsibilities including prevailing wage requirements pursuant to this\narticle.

If the registration of a contractor or subcontractor lapses while\nperforming contracted work on a covered project, that contractor or\nsubcontractor shall not be prohibited from completing its contracted\nwork on such covered project. For a contractor or subcontractor who has\nbeen determined unfit while performing contracted work on a covered\nproject at the time of such determination, then the continuation of its\ncontracted work shall only continue if a monitor is appointed to oversee\nthe work completed at the sole expense of such contractor or\nsubcontractor. Nothing herein shall prevent a contractor or\nsubcontractor from fulfilling contractual obligations solely based on\nreceiving a notice of proposed determination of unfitness. Such monitor\nmust be approved by the commissioner.\n  6. No contractor shall bid on a contract for public work unless such\ncontractor is registered pursuant to this section. In the case of a\ncovered project subject to section two hundred twenty-four-a or two\nhundred twenty-four-d of this article, or other projects that are\nprivately owned and subject to provisions of this article, contractors\nmust register prior to commencing any work on a covered project.\nSubcontractors must be registered prior to commencing any work on a\ncovered project.
