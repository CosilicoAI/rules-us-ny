In\na trade or group of trades in which there is no bona fide employer or\nemployee organization, the joint committee shall be composed of persons\nknown to represent the interests of employers and of employees\nrespectively or a state joint apprenticeship committee may be approved\nas, or the state apprenticeship council may act itself as, the joint\ncommittee in such trade or group of trades. Subject to the review of the\nindustrial commissioner and in accordance with the standards established\nby the industrial commissioner, such committees may devise standards for\napprenticeship agreements and give such aid as may be necessary in their\noperation, in their respective trades and localities.\n</p>
