            <p>Action by personal representative for injury to person or\nproperty.\n  No cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of\nthe death of the person in whose favor the cause of action existed.  For\nany injury an action may be brought or continued by the personal\nrepresentative of the decedent, but punitive damages shall not be\nawarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover\ndamages for personal injury where the death occurs on or before August\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-two. On the trial of any such\naction accruing before September first, nineteen hundred seventy-five,\nwhich is joined with an action for causing death, the contributory\nnegligence of the decedent is a defense, to be pleaded and proved by the\ndefendant.  No cause of action for damages caused by an injury to a\nthird person is lost because of the death of the third person.\n</p>
