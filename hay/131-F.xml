          <p>  § 131-f. Streets outside cities. When any territory in a county\ncontaining an incorporated city of one hundred thousand inhabitants or\nupward, lying outside the limits of such city, has been mapped into\nstreets and avenues pursuant to law, the board of supervisors may\nauthorize the establishment of a plan for the grade of such streets and\navenues; the alteration of such plan of grades, or of any plan thereof\nthat shall have been established by law; the laying out, opening,\ngrading, constructing, closing and change of line or width, of any one\nor more of them, and provide for the assessment on property intended to\nbe benefited thereby, and fixing assessment districts therefor, and for\nthe levy, collection and payment of the amount of damages sustained and\nthe charges and expenses incurred, or which may be necessary to incur in\ncarrying out such provisions; the laying out of new or additional\nstreets and avenues upon the established map or plan thereof, the\nacceptance by town officers of conveyances of lands, for public\nhighways, the naming and changing of names of streets and avenues laid\ndown on said map or plan, and the numbering or renumbering of houses and\nbuilding lots fronting on such streets and avenues. But such last named\npower in regard to the alteration of said map or plan, laying out,\nopening, grading, constructing, closing and change of line, of such\nstreets or avenues, or the numbering or naming thereof, or defraying the\nexpenses thereof, shall only be exercised on the petition of the\nproperty owners, who own more than one-half of the frontage on any such\nstreet or avenue, or on a certificate of the town board and\ncommissioners of highways of the town, that the same is, in their\njudgment, proper and necessary for the public interest. If the streets\nand avenues in respect to which such action is proposed to be taken,\nshall lie in two or more towns, a like certificate shall be required of\nthe town board and commissioners of highways, of each town.  Before\nmaking such certificate, such town board, or boards and commissioners of\nhighways, shall give ten days' notice by publication in one of the daily\npapers of the county, and by conspicuously posting in six public places\nin each of such towns, of the time and place at which they will meet to\nconsider the same, at which meeting the public, and all persons\ninterested, may appear and be heard in relation thereto.  No such street\nor avenue shall be laid out, opened or constructed, upon or across any\nlands acquired by the right of eminent domain, and held in fee for depot\npurposes by any railroad corporation, or upon or across any lands now\nheld by a corporation formed for the purpose of improving the breed of\nhorses, without the consent of such corporations.  No town officer shall\ncharge anything for his services under this section, nor shall any\ncharge be made against any such town or the property therein, for the\nexpense of the publication of the notice herein required.\n</p>
