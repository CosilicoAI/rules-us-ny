The commissioners of appraisal shall cause a notice\nto be published in two such newspapers as aforesaid, once each week for\ntwo weeks successively next preceding the day of meeting mentioned in\nsuch notice, that at a stated time and place within such county they\nwill meet for the purpose of hearing the parties claiming an interest in\nthe compensation to be awarded for the lands taken for such highways.\nSaid notice shall also state the fact that a map or maps showing the\nland acquired had been filed in the county clerk's office. At the time\nand place of said meeting and at any adjournment thereof which said\ncommissioners of appraisal shall publicly make, they shall hear the\nproofs and allegations of all interested parties. They may adjourn the\nproceedings before them from time to time, issue subpoenas or administer\noaths in such proceedings; and shall keep minutes of their proceedings\nand reduce to writing all oral evidence given before them. They shall\nthereafter make and sign a report in writing, to which they shall\nassess, allow and state the amount of compensation to be sustained by\nthe owners of the several lots, pieces or parcels of land taken for the\npurposes aforesaid. Such report shall contain the names of the owners of\nany parcel of land acquired as aforesaid, except that in case the\ncommissioners of appraisal are unable to ascertain the names of such\nowners, they may in place of the names of such undiscovered parties\ninsert the words "unknown owners, " in their report.
