Such sites shall be so located as to give convenient and safe\naccess thereto by vehicular traffic and shall be chosen with regard both\nto the roadside rest and recreational needs of the traveling public and\nsuitability for the purpose.\n  3. The commissioner may in his discretion develop such sites by\nproviding any or all of the following: a water supply, sanitary\nfacilities, parking space for automobiles or such other non-commercial\nfacilities as are suitable for rest and relaxation stops by highway\ntravelers. The commissioner may also permit the installation of vending\nmachines dispensing such food, drink and other articles as he deems\nappropriate or desirable.  Such sites shall be suitably marked and\nmarkings indicating their location may be erected on highways leading\nthereto.\n  4. At the discretion of the commissioner such rest areas may be\nmaintained by state expenses from any appropriation for the maintenance\nof state highways, or he may enter into agreement with any authorized\nmunicipality for the maintenance by the municipality of such a roadside\nrest area for such period and in accordance with such standards as may\nbe agreed upon.\n</p>
