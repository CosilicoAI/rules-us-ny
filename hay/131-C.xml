          <p>  § 131-c. Location and construction of bridges. The board may authorize\nthe location, change of location and construction of any bridge, applied\nfor by any town or towns, jointly, or by other than a municipal\ncorporation, created under a general law, or by any corporation or\nindividual for private purposes; and if a public bridge, erected other\nthan by a municipal corporation, establish the rates of toll for\ncrossing such bridge; but if such bridge is to cross a navigable stream,\nprovision shall be made in the resolution or permission authorizing the\nsame, for the erection and maintenance of a suitable draw, to prevent\nany obstruction of the navigation of such stream; and if a private\nbridge, provision shall be made that the draw shall be kept open as may\nbe required to permit all vessels to pass without loss of headway. When\nsuch bridge shall be intersected by the line of counties, the action of\nthe board of supervisors of each county shall be necessary to give the\njurisdiction herein permitted.  If such bridge is to cross a stream\nwhich is navigable in fact, it, including its abutments, and piers, if\nany, shall be located and constructed in accordance with maps, plans and\nspecifications to be approved by the department of transportation; and\nnot otherwise, and copies of such maps, plans and specifications showing\nthe location, character, design and dimensions of such bridge, and the\nfact of such approval shall be filed in the office of the department of\ntransportation.\n</p>
