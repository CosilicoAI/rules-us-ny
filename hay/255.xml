Whenever complaint in writing on oath,\nshall be made to the town superintendent, of any town in which shall be\nin whole or in part any toll bridge belonging to any person or\ncorporation, representing that such toll bridge has from any cause\nbecome and is unsafe for the public use, such town superintendent shall\nforthwith make a careful and thorough examination of such toll bridge,\nand if upon the examination thereof he shall be of the opinion that the\nsame has from any cause become dangerous or unsafe for public use, he\nshall thereupon give immediate notice to the owners of such toll bridge,\nor to any agent of such owners, acting as such agent in respect to such\nbridge, that he has, on complaint made, carefully and thoroughly\nexamined the bridge, and found it to be unsafe for public use. Such\nowners shall thereupon immediately commence repairing the same, and\ncause such repairs to be made within one week from the day of such\nnotice given, or such reasonable time thereafter as may be necessary to\nthoroughly repair the bridge, so as to make it in all respects safe and\nconvenient for public use. For neglect to take prompt and effective\nmeasures so to repair the bridge, its owners shall forfeit twenty-five\ndollars, and shall not demand or receive any toll for using the bridge\nuntil the same shall be fully repaired. The town superintendent shall\ncause such repairs to be made and the owners of the bridge shall be\nliable for the expense thereof, and for the services of the\nsuperintendent, and upon the neglect or refusal to pay the same upon\npresentation of an account therefor, the town superintendent may recover\nthe same by action, in the name of the town.\n</p>
