            <p>Complete street design features are roadway design features that\naccommodate and facilitate convenient access and mobility by all users,\nincluding current and projected users, particularly pedestrians,\nbicyclists and individuals of all ages and abilities. These features may\ninclude, but need not be limited to: sidewalks, paved shoulders suitable\nfor use by bicyclists, lane striping, bicycle lanes, share the road\nsignage, crosswalks, road diets, pedestrian control signalization, bus\npull outs, curb cuts, raised crosswalks and ramps and traffic calming\nmeasures; and recognize that the needs of users of the road network vary\naccording to a rural, urban and suburban context.\n</p>
