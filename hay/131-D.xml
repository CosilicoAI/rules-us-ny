        <content>
          <p>  § 131-d. Construction by county of destroyed bridges. If any bridge\nwithin a county, or intersected by any boundary line of a county, shall\nbe destroyed by the elements, and the board of supervisors of the county\nshall deem that the expenses of the construction of a new bridge at or\nnear the site of the bridge so destroyed would be too burdensome upon\nthe town or towns within such county, which would otherwise be liable\ntherefor, the board of supervisors of any such county may provide for\nthe construction and completion of a bridge and all necessary approaches\nthereto, at or near the site of the bridge so destroyed. If the bridge\nso destroyed shall have been constructed by a corporation created under\na general law, and the site thereof, and the approaches thereto, or\neither, shall be the property of such corporation, such board of\nsupervisors may purchase the interest of such corporation, or any other\nperson, in such site or approaches, if such purchase can be accomplished\nupon reasonable terms; but if such site or approaches can not be\nlawfully acquired by such purchase, or otherwise, upon reasonable terms,\nsuch board may acquire title to premises on either side of such site,\nand provide for the construction of a bridge and approaches thereto, at\nsuch place, at the expense of the county or of the two counties jointly,\nas the came may be, provided such bridge shall be so located as not to\nincrease the distance to be traveled upon the highway to reach each end\nof such bridge more than five rods. Any board of supervisors providing\nfor the construction of any such bridge may determine by resolution\nwhether the expenses of the maintenance and repair thereof shall\nthereafter be a county charge, or a charge upon such town or towns.\n</p>
