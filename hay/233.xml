          <p>  § 233. State bridges and culverts. 1. The commissioner shall cause an\ninspection to be made of any state bridge or culvert which is reported\nto be unsafe for its posted loading by the regional director or the\ncounty superintendent or the town superintendent. If such bridge or\nculvert is found to be unsafe for such posted loading, the commissioner\nmay cause the signs relating to the loading permitted on such bridge or\nculvert to be modified and it shall be the duty of the regional director\nin whose region such bridge or culvert is located to immediately make\nsuch changes in the signs posted on the bridge or culvert as the\ncommissioner may order, and at the same time the regional director shall\nnotify those responsible for the maintenance of the bridge or culvert of\nsuch action. After such inspection, the bridge or culvert shall have the\nsame status with respect to maintenance and liability as it had prior to\nthe inspection. Any inspection of a bridge performed pursuant to this\nsection shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of sections\ntwo hundred thirty-one and two hundred thirty-two of this article.\n  2. The commissioner may, by an official order, close any state bridge\nor culvert and notify the regional director, the county superintendent,\nthe town superintendent and the supervisor of the town of that fact, and\nif such bridge or culvert is located in more than one town or county,\nthe county superintendent, town superintendent and supervisor of each\ntown, respectively, shall have like notice. After the closing of any\nsuch bridge or culvert, the commissioner shall cause to be erected\nconspicuous signs to the effect that the bridge or culvert is closed to\nall traffic, and shall cause to be erected barricades of a type approved\nby the commissioner.  Neither the state nor any other public entity\nshall be responsible for any damages which may result to any vehicle or\nto any person entering on or traveling over such bridge or culvert after\nthe erection of such barricades and signs.\n  The commissioner may take over, by official order, any bridge or\nculvert located on the state highway system, for the purpose of\nrepairing, altering or reconstructing the structure as provided in this\nsection, and shall thereupon notify the regional director, the county\nsuperintendent of each county or counties and the town superintendent\nand supervisor of each town or towns in which such bridge or culvert is\nlocated by mailing to each of them a copy of said official order. Any\nbridge or culvert, except as hereinafter provided, either closed or\ntaken over by official order as above authorized shall be maintained,\nrepaired, reconstructed, or a bridge or culvert constructed on new\nlocation at the sole expense of the state from the time of such\ncondemnation or taking over, and the commissioner of transportation\nshall supervise such maintenance, repair, reconstruction, or\nconstruction of a new bridge or culvert on a new location, and may pay\nthe cost of same from any funds available for the maintenance, repair,\nreconstruction and construction of state highways and bridges. The\ncommissioner is hereby authorized to make surveys and designs for any\nbridge or culvert located on the state system of highways prior to its\nbeing taken over by official order as authorized in this section, and\nmay pay the cost of same from any funds available for the maintenance,\nrepair, reconstruction and construction of state highways and bridges.\n  After the closing or taking over by official order of any bridge or\nculvert located on the state system of highways, such bridge or culvert\nshall be deemed to be a part of the highway on which such bridge or\nculvert is located.\n  3. The commissioner may let contracts for the repairing, altering,\nreconstruction, or constructing on new location, of any bridge or\nculvert provided for by this section in accordance with the general\nprovisions of section thirty-eight of this chapter, except as\nhereinafter provided. In the performance of work provided by this\nsection, the commissioner may perform the work by the use of\ndepartmental forces and equipment, and purchase materials therefor.\n  4. Whenever a portion of a state bridge or culvert is located within\nthe bounds of a city and the commissioner determines that such bridge or\nculvert should be repaired, altered or reconstructed for public use and\ntravel, he shall prepare plans and specifications therefor which shall\nshow subdivided estimate covering that portion of the bridge or culvert\nlocated within such city boundaries and he shall submit such plans and\nestimate to the city for its examination and the city shall report,\nwithin fifteen days, to the commissioner with such recommendations or\nmodifications the city may desire. That portion of the bridge or culvert\nlying without the city boundaries shall be built and paid for in\naccordance with this section and that portion of the bridge or culvert\nlying within the city boundaries shall be paid for wholly by the city.\nBefore advertising a contract for the construction of such a bridge or\nculvert the commissioner shall submit to the city the amount of the\nestimated cost of that portion of such bridge or culvert which is to be\npaid for by the city and the city shall thereupon provide the money\ntherefor and shall deposit such amount with the state department of\naudit and control to be paid out by it on the audit and warrant of the\ncomptroller on vouchers therefor approved by the commissioner.  Any such\ncity is hereby authorized to provide the means for obtaining such money\nincluding the raising of all or part of such sums pursuant to the local\nfinance law. The commissioner shall authorize and supervise the\nmaintenance of that portion of a bridge or culvert located within the\nbounds of a city and shall pay for the cost of such maintenance in the\nfirst instance from the funds available for the maintenance, repair,\nreconstruction and construction of state highways and bridges, but the\ncity shall, within three months after the receipt of a detailed\nstatement from the commissioner showing the city's share of the cost of\nsuch maintenance work, deposit money equal to the cost of such work with\nthe state.  This subdivision shall not apply to bridges heretofore\nacquired or constructed which have previously been maintained by the\nstate, nor to bridges built pursuant to special acts of the legislature.\nAny bridge located partly within a city constructed and paid for solely\nthrough the use of federal funds shall have the same status with respect\nto maintenance and reconstruction as if such bridge had been constructed\nunder the provisions of this section without the use of such federal\nfunds, and any bridge located wholly within a city so constructed\nthrough the use of such federal funds shall be maintained and\nreconstructed at the sole expense of the city.\n  5.

In such cases, the local municipality or municipalities shall\npetition by resolution for such betterment, and shall deposit the\nnecessary additional funds with the state comptroller in a manner\nsimilar to that provided in section forty-six of this chapter.\n  6. The commissioner of transportation, when requested by a\nmunicipality, public utility company, private corporation, or\nindividual, may provide facilities in bridge or culvert construction for\ncarrying conduits, cables, water pipes and the like.
