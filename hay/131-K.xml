The county legislative body\nmay thereupon adopt a resolution providing for the construction,\nreconstruction or improvement as submitted, or with any modifications it\nmay approve.\n  3. The county legislative body may award a contract for the\nconstruction, reconstruction or improvement, as herein provided.\nHowever, no contract for such work shall be let by the county\nlegislative body until the governing body of such municipality has\nappropriated funds sufficient to pay the estimated cost of relocating or\naltering public authority utilities or municipally owned utilties\nlocated within the designated project area as set forth in the county\nresolution, nor shall the county legislative body award a contract for\nsuch construction, reconstruction or improvement until all necessary\nrights-of-way, easements and land, title to which is not already vested\nin the municipality shall have been acquired by the municipality at the\nmunicipality's expense, and proposed grade crossing eliminations have\nbeen approved by the appropriate authority.\n  4. The construction, reconstruction or improvement authorized by the\ncounty legislative body pursuant to this section shall be performed\nunder the direction and supervision of the county superintendent of\nhighways.\n  5. Payments for construction, reconstruction or improvement authorized\nby the county legislative body pursuant to this section shall be made\nfrom time to time by the county treasurer upon the certificate of the\ncounty superintendent of highways.\n  6. Upon completion of a construction, reconstruction or improvement\nauthorized by the county legislative body pursuant to this section, the\nhighways, bridges or culverts, or sections thereof, shall be thereafter\nmaintained and repaired by the municipality in which they are situated,\nunless the municipality and county shall, by written agreement, provide\nthat such highways, bridges or culverts, or sections thereof, or\napproaches thereto shall be thereafter maintained and repaired by the\ncounty. There shall be no transfer of title to the county from the\nmunicipality therein of any highway, bridge or culvert, or section\nthereof constructed, reconstructed or improved pursuant to this section.\n  7.
