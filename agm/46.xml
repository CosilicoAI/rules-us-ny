          <p>  § 46. Declaration of policy.  It is hereby declared that the dairy\nindustry is a paramount industry of the state and the production,\nprocessing, packaging, distribution and sale of milk products has become\nan enterprise of vast economic importance to the state and of vital\nimportance to the consuming public of the state, and which should be\nencouraged and promoted in the public interest. It is further declared\nthat milk and milk products have long been accepted by the consuming\npublic as wholesome and nutritious articles of food. Advances in food\ntechnology have resulted in the development of a variety of products for\nsimilar usage including dairy foods with different composition than\nproducts now defined as well as products made with vegetable oils and\nproteins from sources other than dairy products, products which are\nsimilar in appearance, odor, or taste to dairy products, and which are\ndifficult to differentiate from dairy products. It is further declared\nto be in the interest of the dairy industry and the consuming public to\npromote and encourage the development of new and different dairy\nproducts with varying proportions of fat, solids and other ingredients,\nincluding wholesome ingredients not now permitted in dairy products but\nwhich may be used without restriction in non-dairy products which are\nsimilar in appearance, odor or taste to dairy products. It is also\ndeclared to be in the interest of the dairy industry and particularly in\nthe interest of the consuming public, that to the fullest extent\npossible, there be uniformity of definitions and standards for milk and\nmilk products and in the labeling of milk and milk products between the\nvarious states to the end that there may be free movement of milk and\nmilk products between states, and further to the end that the\ninefficiency, needless expense, and confusion caused by differences in\nproducts sold under the same name, and differences in labeling of\nidentical products may be eliminated.\n</p>
