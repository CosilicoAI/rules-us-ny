          <p>  § 300. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. It is hereby\nfound and declared that many of the agricultural lands in New York state\nare in jeopardy of being lost for any agricultural purposes. When\nnonagricultural development extends into farm areas, competition for\nlimited land resources results. Ordinances inhibiting farming tend to\nfollow, farm taxes rise, and hopes for speculative gains discourage\ninvestments in farm improvements, often leading to the idling or\nconversion of potentially productive agricultural land.\n  The socio-economic vitality of agriculture in this state is essential\nto the economic stability and growth of many local communities and the\nstate as a whole. It is, therefore, the declared policy of the state to\nconserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of its\nagricultural land for production of food and other agricultural\nproducts. It is also the declared policy of the state to conserve and\nprotect agricultural lands as valued natural and ecological resources\nwhich provide needed open spaces for clean air sheds, as well as for\naesthetic purposes.\n  The constitution of the state of New York directs the legislature to\nprovide for the protection of agricultural lands. It is the purpose of\nthis article to provide a locally-initiated mechanism for the protection\nand enhancement of New York state's agricultural land as a viable\nsegment of the local and state economies and as an economic and\nenvironmental resource of major importance.\n</p>
