If any clause, sentence, paragraph or part of this article shall\nfor any reason be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be\ninvalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the\nremainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause,\nsentence, paragraph, or part thereof, directly involved in the\ncontroversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. No\nprovision of this article shall apply or be construed to apply to\nforeign or interstate commerce, except insofar as the same may be\neffective pursuant to the United States constitution and to the laws of\nthe United States enacted pursuant thereto.
