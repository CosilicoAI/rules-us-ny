          <p>  § 281. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. The legislature\nhereby finds that inflation has caused higher prices in all phases of\nfarm and food production and farm and food products distribution; and\nthat the demand, by consumers within the state, for increasing supplies\nof wholesome, fresh and nutritious farm and food products provides a\nsignificant opportunity for the development of alternative marketing\nstructures for food grown within the state by which such products may be\nsupplied directly to the consuming public. In addition, increasing the\nsupply of wholesome, fresh, locally produced fruits and vegetables can\nhelp to encourage the consumption of such produce in a manner that helps\nto combat the increasing incidence of adult and childhood obesity.\nReducing the incidence of obesity can help to improve the overall health\nof the general public, help to reduce the cost of providing health care\nand reduce the state's costs of providing such care.\n  The legislature finds also that encouraging direct sales from farms\nand other agricultural producers to consumers and other buyers can\nprovide producers with a substantially increased income over that which\nis currently obtainable through the conventional wholesale marketing\nsystem.\n  It is therefore the intent of the legislature and the purpose of this\narticle to encourage expanded production of farm and food products\nthrough providing increased opportunities for farm and food product\nproducers within the state to wholesale and retail their products\ndirectly to consumers on a state, regional and local basis; to encourage\npurchasing opportunities which will lower food costs to consumers; to\nincrease the share of the consumer's food dollar retained by the\nproducers of farm and food products; to make farm and food products more\nreadily available to residents of the state; and to encourage and\nfacilitate the purchase and use of farm and food products produced\nwithin the state by public and private institutions and agencies.\n</p>
