            <p>for adjustments in payments\nto producers to effect a more favorable seasonal balance as between the\nproduction and consumption of milk. Such adjustments may be made in the\nform of deductions and additions to the fund to equalize prices of milk\nto producers, or by apportioning among producers the total value of all\nmilk subject to equalization on the basis of their marketings of milk\nduring a representative period of time. Any such deductions from the\nfund to equalize prices shall not be deemed to be state funds. Such\nmoneys shall be held in reserve and used solely for additions to the\nfund to equalize prices, in such manner as the order may provide. The\ncommissioner shall make no provision for adjustment in payments under\nthis section with respect to a state milk marketing order, except on the\npetition of a producers' bargaining agency of a production area\nsupplying a marketing area and after a public hearing and subsequent\nproducer approval as required by this section.\n  12. "Distributor" as used in this and the preceding section means a\nmilk dealer as defined in this article who delivers milk to stores\nand/or consumers within the marketing area, from a milk depot or milk\nplant owned and/or operated by such dealer.\n</p>
