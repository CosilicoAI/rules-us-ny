Any\nconstruction contract awarded by the authority shall contain such other\nterms and conditions as the authority may deem desirable. The authority\nshall not award any construction contract except to the lowest bidder\nwho, in its opinion, is qualified to perform the work required and who\nis responsible and reliable. The authority may, however, reject any or\nall bids or waive any informality in a bid if it believes that the\npublic interest will be promoted thereby. The authority may reject any\nbid, if, in its judgment, the business and technical organization,\nplant, resources, financial standing, or experience of the bidder\njustifies such rejection in view of the work to be performed.\n  3.

For the purposes of article fifteen-A of the executive law only,\nthe authority shall be deemed a state agency as that term is used in\nsuch article, and all contracts for procurement, design, construction,\nservices and materials shall be deemed state contracts within the\nmeaning of that term as set forth in such article;\n</p>
