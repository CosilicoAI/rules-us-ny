            <p>LILCO is a regulated utility. Under the laws of the state\nproviding for the regulation of utilities, LILCO's future earnings are\nrestricted to the permitted rate of return times LILCO's OCLD.\n  (ii) LILCO presently is being operated as an enterprise the economic\nviability of which is dependent upon extraordinary financial stability\nadjustments by the public service commission. Such extraordinary and\nunprecedented rate relief was granted by the public service commission\nin order to provide cash flow relief to prevent LILCO's bankruptcy with\nthe expectation that ratepayers would receive the full credit of such in\nlower rates, and that the public service commission required such\nextraordinary rate relief to be discontinued in the event that LILCO\nfiled a petition for relief in a voluntary case under the Bankruptcy Act\nor if a final order for relief was entered involuntarily under such act.\nLILCO's lack of profitability results not from any repressive or other\nimproper action taken by any governmental entity but from such factors\nas mismanagement, imprudent decisions regarding the Shoreham plant and\ngeneral inefficiency.\n  (iii) There is no reasonable probability that, after condemnation of\nits assets, LILCO will reproduce them.\n  (iv) Use of RCNLD may result in an unwarranted windfall to LILCO and\nan unjustifiable penalty to the ratepayers who would have to pay it,\nsince to the extent an award based on RCNLD would exceed an award based\non OCLD, it would reflect to a large extent the effects of inflation\nwhich would not increase the value of the property to LILCO or its rate\nbase for ratemaking purposes or to the authority for the purpose of\ncontinuing to generate and transmit electric power within the service\narea.\n</p>
