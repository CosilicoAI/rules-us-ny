Such advertisement shall be published once, not less\nthan one week prior to the date fixed for the opening of bids, in one\nnewspaper having a general circulation in the city of Ogdensburg. The\nauthority may make rules and regulations for the submission of bids and\naward of contract thereon and may provide in such rules and regulations\nthat no performance, bond or undertaking need be furnished by the\ncontractor for the purchase of materials, supplies and equipment in an\namount not exceeding two thousand dollars.
