            <p>limitations on the amount of moneys derived from the properties to\nbe expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the\nauthority.\n  4. It is the intention of the legislature that any pledge of earnings,\nrevenues or other moneys made by the authority shall be valid and\nbinding from the time when the pledge is made; that the earnings,\nrevenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the\nauthority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge\nwithout any physical delivery thereof or further act, and that the lien\nof any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties\nhaving claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the\nauthority irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.\nNeither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is\ncreated need be recorded.\n  5. Neither the members of the authority nor any person executing the\nbonds shall be liable personally on the bonds or be subject to any\npersonal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n  6. The authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor\nto purchase (as distinguished from the power of redemption hereinabove\nprovided) any bonds issued by it at a price of not more than the\nprincipal amount thereof and accrued interest, and all such bonds shall\nbe cancelled.\n  7. In the discretion of the authority, the bonds may be secured by a\ntrust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee,\nwhich may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust\ncompany in the state of New York. Such trust indenture may contain such\nprovisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the\nbondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law,\nincluding covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in\nrelation to the construction, maintenance, operation, repair and\ninsurance of the properties, and the custody, safeguard...</p>
