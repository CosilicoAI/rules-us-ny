The revenues\nor other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the authority\nshall be immediately subject to the lien of such pledge without any\nphysical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge\nshall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any\nkind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority irrespective\nof whether such parties have notice thereof.  Neither the resolution nor\nany other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n  5. Neither the members of the authority nor any person executing the\nbonds shall be liable personally on the bonds or be subject to any\npersonal liability by reason of the issuance thereof, excepting solely\nfor things willfully done or willfully omitted to be done with an intent\nto defraud.\n  6.
