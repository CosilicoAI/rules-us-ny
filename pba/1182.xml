The city shall have the power to acquire\nby purchase or eminent domain proceedings either the fee or such right,\ntitle, interest or easement in such lands as the authority may deem\nnecessary for any of the purposes mentioned in this title, whether\nwithin or without the city, and such lands or interest in such lands may\nbe so acquired whether or not the same are owned or held for public use\nby corporations, associations or persons having the power of eminent\ndomain or otherwise held or used for public purposes, including lands\nheld or used for cemetery purposes. Whenever the authority shall\ndetermine by resolution and certify to the common council of the city\nthat it is necessary to acquire the fee of or such right, title,\ninterest or easement as shall be specified in such resolution, in any\nlands for any of the purposes mentioned in this title, the city may\npurchase such lands or the common council may pass a resolution that it\nhas so determined to take such lands describing them and the estate to\nbe taken therein. Upon such resolution becoming of force, the\ncorporation counsel of the city shall proceed as directed by section\nthree hundred and seventy-four of the charter and all of the proceedings\nhad subsequent to the adoption of such resolution of determination for\nthe acquisition of such lands shall be in the manner prescribed by such\nsection three hundred and seventy-four and subsequent sections of\narticle twenty-one of the charter, provided that it shall be unnecessary\nfor the board of assessors of the city to certify and report to the\ncommon council the district benefited and assessed therefor, nor to\nadopt a resolution of intention or publish the same, and provided that a\nresolution as provided for by section three hundred and eighty-one of\nthe charter, directing the corporation counsel to apply for the\nconfirmation of the whole or any part of the decision in such\nproceedings, may be adopted without the certificate mentioned in such\nsection, that funds have been appropriated or are available; and further\nprovided that the provision of such section relative to the providing of\nfunds shall not apply to the proceeding or proceedings authorized by\nthis title. Such fee, right, title, interest or easement in or to said\nlands shall be taken in the name of the city and payment therefor shall\nbe made by the authority. The power hereby conferred upon the city shall\nnot limit or restrict the power of the authority itself to acquire\nlands, or any right, title, interest or easement therein in the name of\nthe city. Forthwith upon the acquisition by the city, or by the\nauthority in the name of the city, of any such fee, right, title,\ninterest or easement, the same shall, without further act, but by virtue\nof this title, be and become dedicated to the uses and purposes of the\nauthority.\n</p>
