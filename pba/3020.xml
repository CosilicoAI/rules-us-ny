In the event of any such claim,\ndemand, suit or judgment, a director, officer or employee of or\nrepresentative to a municipal assistance corporation shall be saved\nharmless and indemnified, notwithstanding the limitations of section\nseventeen of the public officers law, unless such individual is found by\na final judicial determination not to have acted, in good faith, for a\npurpose which he reasonably believed to be in the best interest of such\ncorporation or not to have had reasonable cause to believe that his\nconduct was lawful.\n  b.

The provisions of this\nsubdivision shall be in addition to and shall not supplant any\nindemnification or other benefits heretofore or hereafter conferred upon\ndirectors, officers or employees of and representatives to the\ncorporation by section seventeen of the public officers law, by action\nof the corporation, or otherwise.
