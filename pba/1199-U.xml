        <content>
          <p>  § 1199-u. County may levy tax within district. Should it appear to the\ncounty legislature at any time that the revenue of the authority is or\nwill be insufficient to provide for the payment of any bonds issued\nunder this title and to reimburse the county for any moneys that it may\nhave advanced to the authority, the county legislature shall determine\nthe amount of money necessary to be raised for such purpose, and shall\nlevy a tax on the territory of the district located within the county\nand upon the several parcels of real estate in the district located\nwithin the county in an amount sufficient to produce the amount\nnecessary to be raised as aforesaid; provided that such tax shall not be\nlevied to pay any bonds of the authority unless the authority with the\nconsent of the county legislature has pledged such tax prior to the\nissuance of such bonds. Such tax shall be levied and apportioned upon\nsuch territory located within the county and collected from the several\nparcels of real estate in the district located within the county in like\nmanner as other county taxes. It is hereby determined that the liability\nimposed upon the territory included in the district located within the\ncounty is based upon the special benefit to such territory accruing\nunder this title and that the tax to be levied because of such liability\nand in proportion to the taxable value of real estate in such territory\nwill be in proportion to such benefits.\n</p>
