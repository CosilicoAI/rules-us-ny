In the case of personal property so\nconveyed, the title shall pass to the authority.\n  2. The village may acquire in the name of the village by purchase or\ncondemnation real property in the village for any of the projects or for\nthe widening of existing roads, streets, avenues or highways, or for new\nroads, streets, avenues or highways within a radius of one mile to any\nof the projects, or partly for such purposes and partly for other\nvillage purposes, by purchase or condemnation in the manner provided by\nlaw for the acquisition of real property by the village.
