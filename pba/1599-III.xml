Notwithstanding the provisions of section fifteen\nhundred ninety-nine-hhh of this title the authority may provide by such\ntrust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the\nrevenues of the project or projects to the trustee under such trust\nindenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement\nthereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All\nexpenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as\na part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repairs of the project\nor projects. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the\nbondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to\nrepresent them, and the trustee under such trust indenture shall have\nand possess all of the powers which are conferred by section fifteen\nhundred ninety-nine-ppp upon a trustee appointed by bondholders.\n  * NB Authority ceased to exist 06/01/1976\n  * NB There are 2 § 1599-iii's\n</p>
