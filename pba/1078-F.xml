Such amounts, excluding\npenalties and interest imposed by the county when collected by the\ncounty collector or receivers of taxes, shall be paid over to the chief\nfinancial officer of the authority. County imposed penalties and\ninterest shall be retained by the county collector or receiver of taxes\nwhich shall become a part of the general funds of the county.
