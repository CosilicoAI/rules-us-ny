The corporation shall have\npower, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, to contract with\nthe holders of any bonds as to the custody, collection, security,\ninvestment and payment of any monies of the corporation or any monies\nheld in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or any way to secure\nbonds, and carry out any such contract notwithstanding that such\ncontract may be inconsistent with the provisions of this section. Monies\nheld in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or in any way to\nsecure bonds and deposits of such monies may be secured in the same\nmanner as monies of the corporation and all banks and trust companies\nare authorized to give such security for such deposits. Any monies of\nthe corporation not required for immediate use or disbursement may, at\nthe discretion of the corporation, be invested in accordance with\nguidelines established by the corporation's board and amended from time\nto time.
