For\npurposes of this section, "municipality" means any county, city, town,\nvillage, district corporation, county or town improvement district,\nschool district, Indian nation or tribe recognized by the state or the\nUnited States with a reservation wholly or partly within the boundaries\nof New York state, any public benefit corporation or public authority\nestablished pursuant to the laws of New York or any agency of New York\nstate which is empowered to construct and operate a wastewater or\ndrinking water infrastructure project, or any two or more of the\nforegoing which are acting jointly in connection with such a project.\n  2. Upon a municipality's formal declaration of an emergency, the\nmunicipality shall provide the department of environmental conservation\nor the department of health, as appropriate, with information to assess\nany situation in which the state of the municipality's wastewater or\nwater infrastructure is causing or may cause an imminent hazard to the\npublic health or welfare, or the environment. After its assessment, if\neither department determines the state of the infrastructure is\nresulting or may result in imminent hazard to the public health or\nwelfare, or to the environment, the corporation shall provide temporary\nemergency assistance, within amounts appropriated, to the municipality\nin an amount not to exceed reasonable costs for infrastructure\nconstruction, replacement, or repair, and related engineering costs,\nthat is immediately necessary to eliminate or substantially reduce such\nhazard.\n  3. The corporation and the municipality shall enter into an agreement\nsigned by an officer duly authorized by the governing body of the\nmunicipality pursuant to which the corporation shall transmit emergency\nfinancial assistance in an amount determined by the department of\nenvironmental conservation or the department of health, as applicable,\nas necessary to address the imminent hazard, and shall provide the\nassistance payment to the municipality within two business days of\nreceipt of such determination. The municipality shall submit an itemized\ncost estimate from the municipality's engineer or engineering consultant\nto the applicable department sufficient to make such determination.\n  4. No later than fourteen days after the cessation of the emergency,\nthe municipality shall provide to the corporation documentation for all\ncosts paid with the emergency assistance and refund to the corporation\nany portion of the financial assistance not used or committed to pay for\nthe construction, replacement, or repair and related engineering costs\ndetermined to be necessary under subdivision one of this section.\n  5.
