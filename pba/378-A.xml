For purposes of this section, the term\n"ambulance" shall have the same meaning as such term is defined by\nsection one hundred-b of the vehicle and traffic law, the term "fire\nvehicle" shall have the same meaning as such term is defined by section\none hundred fifteen-a of the vehicle and traffic law, and the term\n"emergency operation" shall have the same meaning as such term is\ndefined by section one hundred fourteen-b of the vehicle and traffic\nlaw. In any rules and regulations promulgated for the implementation of\nthis section, the authority may establish the type of documentation or\nother proof satisfactory to the authority that an ambulance or fire\nvehicle was engaged in an emergency operation at the time a toll was\nincurred.\n  2.
