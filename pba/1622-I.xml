Neither the members of the authority nor any person executing the\nbonds shall be liable personally on the bonds or be subject to any\npersonal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n  6. The authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor\nto purchase bonds upon such terms and conditions as the authority may\ndetermine.
