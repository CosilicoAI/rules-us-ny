The moneys in such accounts shall be\npaid out on checks of the treasurer upon requisition by the board or of\nsuch other person or persons as the authority may authorize to make such\nrequisitions. All deposits of such moneys shall be secured by\nobligations of (or guaranteed by) the United States of America or of the\nstate or of the county of a market value equal at all times to the\namount on deposit and all banks and trust companies are authorized to\ngive such security for such deposits.

The\nauthority shall have power, notwithstanding the provisions of this\nsection to contract with the holders of any bonds as to the custody,\ncollection, security, investment and payment of any moneys of the\nauthority or any moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of\nbonds or in any way to secure bonds. Moneys held in trust or otherwise\nfor the payment of bonds or in any way to secure bonds and deposits of\nsuch moneys may be secured in the same manner as moneys of the authority\nand all banks and trust companies are authorized to give such security\nfor such deposits.\n</p>
