Except for the purposes of\ncomplying with the internal revenue code, any interest income earned on\nbond proceeds shall only be used to pay debt service on such bonds or\nnotes.\n  In computing for the purposes of this subdivision, the aggregate\namount of indebtedness evidenced by bonds and notes of the authority\nissued pursuant to this subdivision, there shall be excluded the amount\nof such indebtedness represented by such bonds or notes issued to refund\nor otherwise repay bonds or notes, provided that the amount so excluded\nunder this paragraph may exceed the principal amount of such bonds or\nnotes that were issued to refund or otherwise repay only if the present\nvalue of the aggregate debt service on the refunding or repayment bonds\nor notes shall not have at the time of their issuance exceeded the\npresent value of the aggregate debt service of the bonds or notes they\nwere issued to refund or repay, such present value in each case being\ncalculated by using the effective interest rate of the refunding or\nrepayment bonds or notes, which shall be that rate arrived at by\ndoubling the semi-annual interest rate (compounded semi-annually)\nnecessary to discount the debt service payments on the refunding or\nrepayment bonds or notes from the payment date thereof to the date of\nissue of the refunding or repayment bonds or notes and to the price bid\ntherefor, or to the proceeds received by the dormitory authority from\nthe sale thereof, in each case including estimated accrued interest.\n</p>
