The authority shall also make payments in lieu of taxes for those\ntaxes which would otherwise be imposed pursuant to sections one hundred\neighty-six-a and one hundred eighty-six-c of the tax law, and to former\nsection one hundred eighty-six-b of the tax law as such section was in\neffect on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, and any\ntaxes imposed by a city pursuant to the authorization granted by section\ntwenty-b of the general city law.\n  3. No municipality or governmental subdivision, including a school\ndistrict or special district, shall be liable to the authority or any\nother entity for a refund of property taxes originally assessed against\nthe Shoreham plant.
