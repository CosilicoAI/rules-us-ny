The affected board may\nrequest the attendance of representatives of the authority or the city\nboard at a hearing and the authority or the city board shall comply with\nsuch requests. If the proposed project affects two or more school\ndistricts or community boards, then a hearing may be held jointly by the\naffected community school district education council and/or the affected\ncommunity boards.
