For each\nmonth, or part thereof, that the payment in lieu of taxes is delinquent\nbeyond the first month, interest shall accrue to and be paid by the\nproject occupant (where taxes are delinquent because of the occupant's\nfailure to make the required payment) or the agency (because of the\nagency's failure to remit pursuant to subdivision five of this section)\nto the affected tax jurisdiction on the total amount due plus a late\npayment penalty in the amount of one percent per month until the payment\nis made.\n  7.
