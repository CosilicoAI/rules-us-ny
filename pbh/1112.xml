            <p>such substance poses or has the potential to pose a\nsignificant hazard to human health when present in drinking water; (ii)\nsuch substance was recently detected in a public water system and has\nthe potential to be present in other public water systems; and (iii) it\nappears to be prejudicial to the interests of the people to delay action\nby preparing and filing regulations. The commissioner shall, however,\npromulgate regulations adding such new emerging contaminant or\nestablishing such notification level within one year of such\ndeclaration. Such declaration shall clearly state where and the date by\nwhich such testing must occur. After the commissioner promulgates\nregulations adding such emerging contaminant, such regulations shall\nsupersede the declaration issued pursuant to this subdivision. Until\nsuch notification levels are posted on the department's website pursuant\nto subdivision six of this section, the commissioner shall post the\nnotification levels established by declaration on such website so that\nthey are easily accessible through a link to the public.\n  8. Whenever one or more emerging contaminants is confirmed to be\npresent in drinking water at concentrations at or above a notification\nlevel established pursuant to this section:\n  a. the covered public water system shall notify the department within\ntwenty-four hours;\n  b. the covered public water system shall notify all owners of real\nproperty served by the covered public water system in a time and manner\nto be prescribed by the department, provided that in no event shall\nnotification occur more than ninety days after the presence of an\nemerging contaminant at concentrations at or above a notification level\nestablished pursuant to this section is confirmed;\n  c. the commissioner may directly notify such owners of real property\nif it is determined that the public's interest would be best served by\nsuch notification, or if the commissioner determines that the covered\npublic wa...</p>
