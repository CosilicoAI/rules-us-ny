Provided, however, said\nvillage may, by resolution of the village board, limit the local health\ndistrict to that portion of the village lying in the county outside of\nthe county or part-county health district, in which event the\ncompensation of the local health officer shall be based upon the number\nof inhabitants in the reduced village health district, and the residents\nof that portion of the village lying within the county or part-county\nhealth district shall not be taxed by the village for the maintenance of\nsuch reduced local health district.\n  3. The governing authorities of any city, village or town or the\ngoverning authorities of the cities, villages or towns within a\nconsolidated health district may abolish such city, village, town or\nconsolidated health district as a local health district, whereupon all\nthe powers and duties of the local board of health of such local health\ndistrict shall devolve upon the board of health of the county or\npart-county health district and all the powers and duties of the local\nhealth officer of such local health district shall devolve upon the\ncounty health commissioner.\n  4.

Such public health nurse, or nurses,\nshall work under the direction of the county health commissioner.\n  5. Where the local health district within the area of any county or\npart county health district is a town in which there are one or more\nincorporated villages and the local board of health is a town board,\nappropriations made by the town board for the purposes stated in\nsubdivisions one and four of this section shall be a charge upon the\ntaxable property of that part of the town outside of any incorporated\nvillage.\n  If a proposition is submitted as provided in subdivision four of this\nsection for the employment of public health nurses in a town in which\nthere are incorporated villages which constitute a local health\ndistrict, only such persons who are electors and owners of record of\nproperty in the town outside of incorporated villages shall be entitled\nto vote upon such a proposition.\n</p>
