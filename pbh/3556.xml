As part of such review, the department shall consult with\nexperts in the fields of skin cancer research and human exposure to\nartificial ultraviolet radiation. The department shall also review the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of requiring appearance enhancement\nbusinesses conducting the practice of nail specialty, as defined in\nsubdivision four of section four hundred of the general business law, to\nadvise users of ultraviolet nail drying devices to apply a sunscreen or\na similar substance designed to block ultraviolet radiation to the hands\nand wrists prior to using such device.\n  2. Upon completion of such review, based on the findings of the\ndepartment, the department of state may promulgate any regulations\ndeemed appropriate for governing the use of ultraviolet nail drying\ndevices by any appearance enhancement business, required to be licensed\nby the department of state pursuant to article twenty-seven of the\ngeneral business law. If promulgated, such regulations shall include a\nrequirement that any appearance enhancement business conducting the\npractice of nail specialty post a notice regarding any health hazards\nassociated with the use of ultraviolet nail dryers and any steps users\nmay take to mitigate such hazards in an area clearly visible to patrons\nin the licensed premises or in the place where the practice of an\noccupation licensed pursuant to article twenty-seven of the general\nbusiness law is conducted.\n</p>
