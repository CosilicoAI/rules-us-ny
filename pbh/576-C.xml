All reports shall be\nsent electronically to the department in a standards based electronic\nformat, using a network, communications protocol, clinical syntax and\nvocabulary all as determined by the commissioner to be compatible with\nnational health information standards promulgated by the federal centers\nfor disease control and prevention and the department of health and\nhuman services. Reports shall be submitted on a schedule determined by\nthe commissioner.\n  2.
