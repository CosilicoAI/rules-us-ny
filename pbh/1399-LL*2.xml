            <p>Any person operating a tobacco business wherein bidis is sold\nor offered for sale may perform a transaction scan as a precondition for\nsuch purchases.\n  (ii) In any instance where the information deciphered by the\ntransaction scan fails to match the information printed on the driver's\nlicense or non-driver identification card, or if the transaction scan\nindicates that the information is false or fraudulent, the attempted\ntransaction shall be denied.\n  (iii) In any proceeding pursuant to section thirteen hundred\nninety-nine-ee of this article, it shall be an affirmative defense that\nsuch person had produced a driver's license or non-driver identification\ncard apparently issued by a governmental entity, successfully completed\nthat transaction scan, and that the bidis had been sold, delivered or\ngiven to such person in reasonable reliance upon such identification and\ntransaction scan. In evaluating the applicability of such affirmative\ndefense the commissioner shall take into consideration any written\npolicy adopted and implemented by the seller to effectuate the\nprovisions of this chapter. Use of a transaction scan shall not excuse\nany person operating a tobacco business wherein bidis is sold, or the\nagent or employee of such person, from the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence otherwise required by this chapter. Notwithstanding the above\nprovisions, any such affirmative defense shall not be applicable in any\ncivil or criminal proceeding, or in any other forum.\n</p>
