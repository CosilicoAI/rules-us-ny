        <content>
          <p>  § 1501. Municipal mosquito control; costs to owner and municipality.\n1. Whenever the board of health of a municipality shall determine that\nany accumulation of water wherein mosquito larvae breed, constitutes a\nnuisance or a danger or injury to life or health, the owner or owners of\nthe premises on which the breeding place is located shall bear the\nexpense of its suppression or removal, or so much thereof as the local\nboard of health shall determine to be equitable as hereinafter provided.\n  2. If the local board of health of a municipality shall determine\nthat, owing to the natural conditions which are favorable to the\nbreeding of mosquitoes and owing to the benefit to be secured to the\npublic by the suppression of such conditions, a part of the expense of\nsuch suppression or removal shall be borne by the owner of such premises\nand a part thereof by the municipality wherein the premises are\nsituated, such owner or occupant may proceed to suppress or remove such\nbreeding place and shall be reimbursed by the municipality for such\nproportion of the reasonable expense of such suppression or removal as\nthe board of health shall have determined should be borne by the\nmunicipality.\n  3. For the purpose of ascertaining the actual cost of such suppression\nor removal, the board of health of the municipality or its duly\nauthorized agents may at all times have access to the premises whereon\nthe work is being carried on; and the owner of the premises shall\nfurnish to such board of health such information as the board of health\nmay deem necessary or desirable for the purpose of ascertaining such\nactual cost.\n  4. If in any such case the owner of the premises shall not proceed,\nwithin a reasonable time, to suppress or remove such breeding place, the\nboard of health of the municipality may proceed to suppress and remove\nthe same, and for such proportion of the expense of such suppression and\nremoval as the board of health shall have determined to be equitable, an\naction may be maintained against such owner, and the same shall become a\nfirst lien upon the premises.\n</p>
