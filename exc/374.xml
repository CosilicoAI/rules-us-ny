            <p>findings on the extent of existing federal, state and local\nrequirements for assistive listening systems,\n  (ii) findings on the type, design and use of existing assistive\nlistening systems,\n  (iii) recommendations for design and installation standards for\nassistive listening systems intended for places of public assembly, and\n  (iv) recommendations for capacity standards for places of public\nassembly which shall be required to install assistive listening systems.\n  c. In developing such recommendations the advisory board shall take\ninto consideration the costs of such systems, the standardization and\ncompatibility of such systems, if the technology permits, and the\nutilization of such systems by the consumer who is deaf or hard of\nhearing. Particular attention should be given to the ability of\nconsumers to utilize a single receiver which is compatible in a variety\nof installations employing the same assistive listening device\ntechnology.\n  d. In addition, the advisory board shall ensure, to the extent\npossible, that the standards developed for the design and installation\nof assistive listening systems take into consideration the opportunity\nfor competition among manufacturers of the same or various approved\nsystems.\n</p>
