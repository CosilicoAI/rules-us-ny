          <p>  § 201-a. State clean-fueled vehicle program. 1. There shall be created\nwithin the office of general services a clean-fueled vehicle program,\nwith the purpose of acquiring clean-fueled vehicles for state use and\ntesting and evaluating clean-fueled vehicle technologies.\n  2. For the purposes of this section, the term "clean-fueled vehicle"\nshall mean any motor vehicle as defined in section one hundred\ntwenty-five of the vehicle and traffic law, that uses electricity,\neither stored or generated on-board, as its primary motive force or that\nis fueled by compressed natural gas, propane, methanol, hydrogen or\nethanol.\n  3. The office of general services, in coordination with the New York\nstate energy research and development authority, and the department of\nenvironmental conservation, shall be responsible for developing a state\nclean-fueled vehicle strategy which shall determine how best to\nincorporate clean-fueled vehicles into the state fleet. In developing\nthe strategy, the office of general services shall consider such factors\nas: the duty to be performed by the vehicle, the terrain and climate of\nthe area of the state in which the vehicle is to be used, and other\nfactors the office of general services, in coordination with the New\nYork state energy research and development authority and the department\nof environmental conservation, deem relevant.\n  4. The office of general services, in coordination with the New York\nstate energy research and development authority, the department of motor\nvehicles and the department of environmental conservation, shall issue a\nreport to the governor and the legislature on or before April first,\nnineteen hundred ninety-seven setting forth the state's strategy for the\nacquisition and utilization of clean-fueled vehicles and shall update\nsuch strategy periodically.\n  5. Such report shall include, at a minimum, a description of the\nstate's strategies to promote the use of clean-fueled vehicles by the\ngeneral public and in the state fleet. Such strategies shall include:\nnecessary amendments of state procurement policies to allow and\nencourage acquisition of clean-fueled vehicles, development of policy\nrecommendations to establish incentives for acquisition of clean-fueled\nvehicles for use by individuals and private fleets, expeditious review\nof policies and procedures identified as barriers to clean-fueled\nvehicle introduction, and revision of such policies and procedures as\nappropriate. The report shall also assess existing infrastructure,\ndetermine what changes are necessary to support a sustainable\nclean-fueled vehicles market and recommend how best to implement those\nchanges. The report shall assess factors including but not limited to\nthe following: the availability and viability of existing or developing\ntechnology, sufficient public recharging/refueling capability, standards\nfor recharging/refueling technologies, utility power quality, vehicle\nregistration considerations, public outreach and safety training,\nbattery recycling capability, insurance and liability considerations,\nand clean-fueled vehicle acquisition incentives. The report shall also\ndetermine the number of clean-fueled vehicles for immediate use in the\nstate fleet that can be supported by existing infrastructure.\n  6. Immediately after submission of the report defined in subdivision\nfive of this section, the office of general services shall begin a\nproject to implement the recommendations and strategies of such report.\n  7. The office of general services shall develop a specific plan to\nprocure and install necessary infrastructure for a sustainable state\nclean-fueled vehicle fleet, including a time frame for such procurement\nand installation. In developing such plan, the office of general\nservices shall consider to the greatest extent possible any steps which\nwill encourage the utilization of clean-fueled vehicles by the private\nsector. The office of general services shall either begin to acquire and\ninstall necessary infrastructure or issue requests for proposals for\nsuch procurement and installation, no later than January first, nineteen\nhundred ninety-eight, provided however, that no acquisition of\nclean-fueled vehicles, or installation of associated infrastructure,\nfrom the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to the Clean Water/Clean Air\nBond Act of 1996, shall occur prior to April first, nineteen hundred\nninety-seven.\n  8. The office of general services shall develop a specific plan for\nthe procurement of clean-fueled vehicles for use in the state fleet.\nProcurement of clean-fueled vehicles and utilization in the state fleet\nusing proceeds of bonds sold pursuant to the Clean Water/Clean Air Bond\nAct of 1996 shall begin as soon as possible after the issuance of, and\nin accordance with, the report defined in subdivision five of this\nsection.\n  9. The office of general services, department of economic development,\nand the department of environmental conservation, shall evaluate the\npotential for developing a private clean-fueled vehicle industry in the\nstate and submit recommendations from time to time to the legislature\nand the governor for attracting such industry, by either established\nmotor vehicle producers or other companies, to the state.\n</p>
