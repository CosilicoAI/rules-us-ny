          <p>  § 157. Granting authority. The division of homeland security and\nemergency services by and through the commissioner of the division of\nhomeland security and emergency services or his duly authorized officers\nand employees, shall administer, carry out and approve grants of funds\nfrom moneys allocated and appropriated therefor, for authorized arson,\nfire prevention and control expenditures as defined herein, that are\nconducted by municipal corporations. "Authorized arson, fire prevention\nand control expenditures" shall mean those expenditures utilized by a\nmunicipal corporation for fire or arson prevention, fire or arson\ninvestigation and arson prosecution. No expenditure which has not been\nspecifically designated by the local legislative body for arson, fire\nprevention and control and approved by the office of fire prevention and\ncontrol pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated thereby shall be\nconsidered an "authorized arson, fire prevention and control\nexpenditure." The division of homeland security and emergency services\nshall adopt, amend and rescind such rules, regulations and guidelines as\nmay be necessary for the performance of its functions, powers and duties\nunder this section. The division of homeland security and emergency\nservices shall allocate grants under this article among the\nmunicipalities whose applications have been approved in such a manner as\nwill most nearly provide an equitable distribution of the grants among\nmunicipalities, taking into consideration such factors as the level of\nsuspected arson activity, population and population density, the need\nfor state funding to carry out local programs, and the potential of the\nmunicipalities to effectively employ such grants.\n</p>
