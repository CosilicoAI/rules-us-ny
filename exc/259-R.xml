Such\nphysician shall either be employed by the department, shall render\nprofessional services at the request of the department, or shall be\nemployed by a hospital or medical facility used by the department for\nthe medical treatment of incarcerated individuals. The diagnosis shall\nbe reported to the commissioner and shall include but shall not be\nlimited to a description of the terminal condition, disease or syndrome\nsuffered by the incarcerated individual, a prognosis concerning the\nlikelihood that the incarcerated individual will not recover from such\nterminal condition, disease or syndrome, a description of the\nincarcerated individual's physical or cognitive incapacity which shall\ninclude a prediction respecting the likely duration of the incapacity,\nand a statement by the physician of whether the incarcerated individual\nis so debilitated or incapacitated as to be severely restricted in his\nor her ability to self-ambulate or to perform significant normal\nactivities of daily living.
