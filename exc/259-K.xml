The board shall make rules for the purpose of maintaining the\nconfidentiality of records, information contained therein and\ninformation obtained in an official capacity by officers, employees or\nmembers of the board of parole.\n  3. Members of the board and officers and employees of the department\nproviding community supervision services and designated by the\ncommissioner shall have free access to all incarcerated individuals\nconfined in institutions under the jurisdiction of the department, the\noffice of children and family services and the department of mental\nhygiene in order to enable them to perform their functions, provided,\nhowever, that the department of mental hygiene may temporarily restrict\nsuch access where it determines, for significant clinical reasons, that\nsuch access would interfere with its care and treatment of the mentally\nill incarcerated individual. If under the provisions of this subdivision\nan incarcerated individual is not accessible for release consideration\nby the board, that incarcerated individual shall be scheduled to see the\nboard in the month immediately subsequent to the month within which he\nor she was not available.\n  4.

The department and\nboard shall promulgate rules for the transmission of records required to\nbe provided under this section.\n</p>
