Such hearing\nshall be conducted by the appropriate authority of the contracting\nagency to review the determination of disqualification. A final\nadministrative determination made following such hearing shall be\nreviewable in a proceeding commenced under article seventy-eight of the\ncivil practice law and rules, provided that such proceeding is commenced\nwithin thirty days of the notice given by certified mail return receipt\nrequested rendering such final administrative determination. Such\nproceeding shall be commenced in the supreme court, appellate division,\nthird department and such proceeding shall be preferred over all other\ncivil causes except election causes, and shall be heard and determined\nin preference to all other civil business pending therein, except\nelection matters, irrespective of position on the calendar.

If, based on such considerations, the\ncontracting agency determines there is not a reasonable availability of\ncontractors on the list of certified business to furnish services for\nthe project, it shall issue a waiver of compliance to the contractor.
