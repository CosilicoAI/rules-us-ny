          <p>  § 534-v. Refusal to answer question, immunity; prosecution. 1. In any\ninvestigation, interview or other proceeding conducted under oath by the\ncommission or any duly authorized officer, employee or agent thereof, if\na person refuses to answer a question or produce evidence of any other\nkind on the ground that the person may be incriminated thereby, and,\nnotwithstanding such refusal, an order is made upon twenty-four hours'\nprior written notice to the attorney general of the state of New York,\nand to the appropriate district attorney or prosecutor having an\nofficial interest therein, by the commissioner or by the commissioner's\ndesignees appointed pursuant to the provisions of subdivision three of\nsection five hundred thirty-four-c of this article, that such person\nanswer the question or produce the evidence, such person shall comply\nwith the order. If such person complies with the order, and if, but for\nthis subdivision, would have been privileged to withhold the answer\ngiven or the evidence produced by the person, then immunity shall be\nconferred upon the person, as provided for in this section. "Immunity"\nas used in this subdivision means that such person shall not be\nprosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account\nof any transaction, matter or thing concerning which, in accordance with\nthe order by the commission or the commissioner's designees appointed\npursuant to the provisions of subdivision three of section five hundred\nthirty-four-c of this article, such person gave answer or produced\nevidence, and that no such answer given or evidence produced shall be\nreceived against the person upon any criminal proceeding. But the person\nmay nevertheless be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for\nany perjury or contempt committed in answering, or failing to answer, or\nin producing or failing to produce evidence, in accordance with the\norder, and any such answer given or evidence produced shall be\nadmissible against the person upon any criminal proceeding concerning\nsuch perjury or contempt. Immunity shall not be conferred upon any\nperson except in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. If,\nafter compliance with the provisions of this subdivision, a person is\nordered to answer a question or produce evidence of any other kind and\ncomplies with such order, and it is thereafter determined that the\nattorney general or appropriate district attorney or prosecutor having\nan official interest therein not notified, such failure or neglect shall\nnot deprive such person of any immunity otherwise properly conferred\nupon the person.\n  2. If a person, in obedience to a subpoena directing the person to\nattend and testify, comes into this state from another state, the person\nshall not, while in this state pursuant to such subpoena, be subject to\narrest or the service of process, civil or criminal, in connection with\nmatters which arose before the person's entrance into this state under\nthe subpoena.\n</p>
