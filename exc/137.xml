No official act of such notary public shall be\nheld invalid on account of the failure to comply with these provisions.\nIf any notary public shall willfully fail to comply with any of the\nprovisions of this section, the notary public shall be subject to\ndisciplinary action by the secretary of state. In all the courts within\nthis state the certificate of a notary public, over the signature of the\nnotary public, shall be received as presumptive evidence of the facts\ncontained in such certificate; provided, that any person interested as a\nparty to a suit may contradict, by other evidence, the certificate of a\nnotary public.\n</p>
