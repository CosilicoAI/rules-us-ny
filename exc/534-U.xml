In addition to the\ngrounds elsewhere set forth in this article, any license or registration\nissued or made pursuant thereto may be revoked or suspended for such\nperiod as the commission deems in the public interest or the licensee or\nregistrant may be reprimanded, for:\n  1. Conviction of any crime or offense in relation to gambling if the\ncrime or offense was committed at or on a pier or other waterfront\nterminal or within five hundred feet thereof;\n  2. Willful commission of, or willful attempt to commit at or on a\nwaterfront terminal or adjacent highway, any act of physical injury to\nany other person or of willful damage to or misappropriation of any\nother person's property, unless justified or excused by law;\n  3. Receipt or solicitation of anything of value from any person other\nthan a licensee's or registrant's employer as consideration for the\nselection or retention for employment of such licensee or registrant;\n  4. Coercion of a licensee or registrant to make purchases from or to\nutilize the services of any person;\n  5. Refusal to answer any material question or produce any evidence\nlawfully required to be answered or produced at any investigation,\ninterview or other proceeding conducted by the commission pursuant to\nthe provisions of this act, or, if such refusal is accompanied by a\nvalid plea of privilege against self-incrimination, refusal to obey an\norder to answer such question or produce such evidence made by the\ncommission pursuant to the provisions of subdivision one of section five\nhundred thirty-four-v of this article;\n  6. Association with a person who has been identified by a federal,\nstate, or local law enforcement agency as a member or associate of an\norganized crime group, a terrorist group, or a career offender cartel,\nor who is a career offender, under circumstances where such association\ncreates a reasonable belief that the participation of the licensee or\nregistrant in any activity required to be licensed under this act would\nbe inimical to the policies of this article, provided however that\nassociation without the requisite showing of inimicality as set forth\nherein shall be insufficient grounds for revocation; or\n  7. Conviction of a racketeering activity or knowing association with a\nperson who has been convicted of a racketeering activity by a court of\nthe United States or any state or territory thereof under circumstances\nwhere such association creates a reasonable belief that the\nparticipation of the licensee or registrant in any activity required to\nbe licensed under this act would be inimical to the policies of this\narticle, provided, however, that association without the requisite\nshowing of inimicality as set forth herein shall be insufficient grounds\nfor revocation.\n</p>
