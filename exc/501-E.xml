The\ncompacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the\nsafe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so\nhave left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize\nthat congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112\n(1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts\nand mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of\nthis compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the\ncompacting states to:\n  A. ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject\nto this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the\nreceiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority\nin the sending state;\n  B. ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including\nthe victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving\nstates are adequately protected;\n  C. return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from\nsupervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state\nrequesting their return;\n  D. make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public\nfacilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special\nservices;\n  E. provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;\n  F. equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the\ncompacting states;\n  G. establish procedures to manage the movement between states of\njuvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of\ncourts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice\nagency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;\n  H. insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders\nare authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;\n  I. establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against\njuvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under\nthe terms of this compact;\n  J. establish a system of uniform data collection on information\npertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by\nauthorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular\nreporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial,\nand legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice\nadministrators;\n  K. monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of\njuveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct\nnoncompliance;\n  L. coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of\ninterstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such\nactivity; and\n  M. coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the\ninterstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact\nfor adult offender supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles\nparticularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision\nissues arise.\n  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities\nconducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation\nof public policies and therefore are public business.
