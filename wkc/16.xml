If the injury causes death, the compensation\nshall be known as a death benefit and shall be payable in the amount and\nto or for the benefit of the persons following:\n  1. Funeral expenses. The chair shall prepare and establish a schedule\nfor the state or schedules limited to defined localities of maximum\ncharges and fees for such funeral expenses, to be determined in\naccordance with, and to be subject to change pursuant to, rules\npromulgated by the chair. Before preparing such schedule for the state\nor schedules for limited localities, the chair shall request the\npresident of the New York state funeral directors' association to submit\nto the chair a report on the amount of remuneration deemed by such\nassociation to be fair and adequate for the types of funeral services\nrendered under this chapter, but consideration shall also be given to\nthe views of other interested parties. The amounts payable by the\nemployer for such services shall be the actual fees and charges up to\nthe maximum established by such schedule. Provided, however, no such\nschedule of charges and fees shall apply where a firefighter dies from\ninjuries received in the line of duty as a direct result of firefighting\nor where a police officer dies from injuries received in the line of\nduty as a direct result of law enforcement activities, where such\nfuneral expenses are reasonable. If such funeral expenses shall have\nbeen paid by the claimants entitled to compensation under this section\nor by others, the funeral expenses awarded shall be made payable to such\nclaimants or others, otherwise they shall be made payable to the\nundertaker who shall have provided burial.
