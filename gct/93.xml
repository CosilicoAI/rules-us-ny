So long as any woman is\ndetained or held under arrest in a police station to which a police\nmatron is attached, it shall be the duty of such matron to remain\nconstantly thereat, ready for service; or if there be more than one\nmatron attached to such station, then one of them shall be constantly\nready for service.  A police matron shall, subject to the officer in\ncharge of such station house, have the immediate care and charge of all\nwomen held under arrest in the station to which she is attached, and she\nmay at any time call upon the officer in charge of such station for\nassistance. She shall be subject to the authority of the board of\npolice, or if there be no such board, then to the chief of police in the\ncity where she may be appointed, and to the rules prescribed by such\nauthority, but at a station where she may be on duty she shall be\nsubject only to the authority of the officer in charge thereof.\n</p>
