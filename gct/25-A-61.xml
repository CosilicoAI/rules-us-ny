            <p>General.--If upon examination of a\ntaxpayer's return under this local law the administrator determines that\nthere is a deficiency of income tax, he may mail a notice of deficiency\nto the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file an income tax return\nrequired under this local law, the administrator is authorized to\nestimate the taxpayer's city taxable income and tax thereon, from any\ninformation in its possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to the\ntaxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or\nregistered mail to the taxpayer at his last known address in or out of\nthe city. If a husband and wife are jointly liable for tax, a notice of\ndeficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the\nadministrator has been notified by either spouse that separate\nresidences have been established, then, in lieu of the single joint\nnotice, a duplicate original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each\nspouse at his or her last known address in or out of the city. If the\ntaxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency\nmay be mailed to his last known address in or out of the city, unless\nthe administrator has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary\nrelationship with respect to the taxpayer.\n</p>
