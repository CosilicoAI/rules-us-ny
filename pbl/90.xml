          <p>  § 90. Accelerating or impeding flow of mineral waters.  Pumping, or by\nany artificial contrivance whatsoever in any manner accelerating the\nnatural flow, or producing an unnatural flow of that class of mineral\nwaters holding in solution natural mineral salts and an excess of\ncarbonic acid gas from any well made by boring or drilling into the\nrock, or pumping, or by any artificial contrivance whatsoever in any\nmanner accelerating the natural flow or producing an unnatural flow, of\nnatural carbonic acid gas issuing from or contained in any well made by\nboring or drilling into the rock, is hereby declared to be unlawful.\nPumping, or by any artificial contrivance whatsoever in any manner\naccelerating the natural flow, or producing an unnatural flow, of that\nclass of mineral waters holding in solution natural mineral salts and an\nexcess of carbonic acid gas from any well made by boring or drilling\ninto the rock, or pumping, or by any artificial contrivance whatsoever\nin any manner accelerating the natural flow, or producing an unnatural\nflow of, natural carbonic acid gas issuing from or contained in any well\nmade by boring or drilling into the rock, by reason whereof the natural\nflow from any mineral spring or any mineral well belonging to any other\nperson or corporation, is impeded, retarded, diminished, diverted or\nendangered, or the quality of its waters is impaired, or the quantity of\nits carbonic acid gas or mineral ingredients diminished, is hereby\ndeclared to be unlawful. Pumping, or otherwise drawing by artificial\nappliance from any well made by boring or drilling into the rock, that\nclass of mineral waters holding in solution natural mineral salts and an\nexcess of carbonic acid gas, or pumping, or by any artificial\ncontrivance whatsoever in any manner producing an unnatural flow of,\ncarbonic acid gas issuing from or contained in any well made by boring\nor drilling into the rock, for the purpose of extracting, collecting,\ncompressing, liquefying or vending such gas as a commodity otherwise\nthan in connection with the mineral water and the other mineral\ningredients with which it was associated, is hereby declared to be\nunlawful. The doing of any act or thing whatsoever whereby the natural\nflow from any spring or well of that class of mineral waters holding in\nsolution natural mineral salts and an excess of carbonic acid gas, is\nimpeded, retarded, diminished, diverted or endangered, or the quality of\nits waters is impaired, or the quantity of its carbonic acid gas or\nmineral ingredients diminished, is hereby declared to be unlawful.\n</p>
