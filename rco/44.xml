        <content>
          <p>  § 44. Changing the number of vestrymen of Protestant Episcopal\nparishes hereafter incorporated. If the vestry of a Protestant Episcopal\nparish, hereafter incorporated, shall, by resolution, recommend that the\nnumber of vestrymen of such parish be changed to either three, six,\nnine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty-one or twenty-four vestrymen,\nnotice of such recommendation shall be included in the notice of the\nnext annual election of such parish, or in the notice of a special\nmeeting to be held not less than six months before the time fixed for\nholding the next annual election thereafter, and be submitted to such\nannual or special meeting. If such recommendation be ratified by such\nmeeting, the presiding officer thereof, and at least two qualified\nvoters present thereat, shall execute and acknowledge a certificate\nsetting forth such resolution of the vestry, the fact that notice\nthereof had been given with the notice of such annual election, or with\nthe notice of such special meeting as the case may be; that the meeting\nhad ratified the same; and the number of vestrymen so decided on. Such\ncertificate shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in\nwhich the original certificate of incorporation is filed and recorded,\nand such change in the number of vestrymen shall take effect at the time\nof the next annual election thereafter. If the number of vestrymen be\nthereby increased, then, in addition to the number of vestrymen to be\nelected at such annual election, one-third of such increased number of\nvestrymen shall be elected to hold office for one year thereafter,\none-third of such increased number shall be elected to hold office for\ntwo years thereafter, and one-third of such increased number shall be\nelected to hold office for three years thereafter. If the number of\nvestrymen by such change be reduced, such reduction shall not affect the\nterm of office of any vestryman duly elected, and at such next annual\nelection and at each annual election thereafter, one-third of such\nreduced number of vestrymen shall be elected to hold office for three\nyears.\n</p>
