If the ministers, elders and deacons\nwho, at any time, by virtue of their offices, constitute the trustees of\nany Reformed church in America, or of any true Reformed Dutch church in\nthe United States of America, determine that the trustees of such church\nshall thereafter be elective in pursuance of article ten of this\nchapter, and shall determine whether the number of such trustees shall\nbe three, six or nine, and the date of the annual corporate meeting of\nthe church, they may sign, acknowledge and cause to be filed and\nrecorded in the office of the clerk of the county in which the\ncertificate of incorporation of such church is filed or recorded, a\ncertificate of such determinations. Thereafter the trustees of such\nchurch shall be elective in pursuance of the provisions of article ten\nof this chapter, relating to the election of trustees of incorporated\nchurches. At the next annual corporate meeting after the filing of such\ncertificate, one-third of the number of trustees so determined on shall\nbe elected to hold office for one year, one-third for two years and\none-third for three years, and the minister, elders and deacons shall\ncease to be the trustees of such church. At each subsequent annual\ncorporate meeting of such church, one-third of the number of trustees so\ndetermined on shall be elected to hold office for three years. If the\ntrustees of an incorporated Reformed church in America or of a true\nDutch Reformed church in the United States of America are at any time\nelective, in pursuance of article ten of this chapter, or otherwise, the\nboard of trustees and the consistory thereof may concurrently determine\nthat the minister or ministers, if any, and the elders and deacons of\nsuch church shall constitute the trustees thereof.  Thereon the\npresident and clerk of the consistory and the president and clerk of the\nboard of trustees shall sign and acknowledge and cause to be filed and\nrecorded in the office of the clerk of the county in which the original\ncertificate of incorporation is filed or recorded, a certificate of such\ndetermination, stating the names of such ministers, elders and deacons.\nOn so filing and recording such certificate, such board of trustees\nshall be dissolved, and the minister or ministers, and elders and\ndeacons of such church, and their successors in office shall constitute\nthe trustees of such church.\n</p>
