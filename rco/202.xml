In case of the death of all the trustees of any trust for\nthe benefit of any meeting of the Religious Society of Friends or any of\nthe purposes thereof, heretofore appointed, or who may be hereafter\nappointed by virtue of this section, any such meeting may appoint a\ntrustee or trustees in place of such person or persons, and the person\nor persons thus appointed by such meeting shall succeed to, and be\ninvested with, all the powers, rights and duties conferred by this\nsection and the deed or declaration of trust upon the trustee or\ntrustees.
