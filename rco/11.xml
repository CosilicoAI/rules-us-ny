If, in a conveyance of real property, or in any\ninstrument intended to operate as such, heretofore or hereafter made to\na religious corporation, its corporate name is not stated or is not\ncorrectly stated, but such conveyance or instrument indicates the\nintention of the grantor therein to convey such property to such\ncorporation, and such corporation has entered into possession and\noccupation of such property, any officer of the corporation authorized\nso to do by its trustees may record in the office where such conveyance\nor instrument is recorded a statement, signed and acknowledged by him or\nproved, setting forth the date of such conveyance or instrument, the\ndate of record and the number and page of the book of record thereof,\nthe name of the grantor, a description of the property conveyed or\nintended to be conveyed, the name of the grantee as expressed in such\nconveyance or instrument, the correct name of such corporation, the fact\nof authorization by the trustees of the corporation, to make and record\nsuch statement, and that the grantor in such conveyance or instrument\nintended thereby to convey such property to such corporation as the said\nofficer verily believes, with the reason for such belief. Such statement\nso signed and acknowledged or proved shall be recorded with the records\nof deeds in such office, and indexed as a deed from the grantee as named\nin such instrument or in such conveyance to such corporation. The\nregister or clerk, as the case may be, shall note the recording of such\nstatement on the margin of the record of such conveyance, and for his\nservices shall be entitled to receive the fees allowed for recording\ndeeds. Such statement so recorded shall be presumptive evidence that\nsuch matters therein stated are true, and that such corporation was the\ngrantee in the original instrument or conveyance. All conveyances\nheretofore made, or by any instrument intended to be made, to a\nreligious corporation of real property appropriated to the use of such\ncorporation, or entitled to be so appropriated, are hereby confirmed and\ndeclared valid and effectual, notwithstanding any defect in the form of\nthe conveyance or the description of the grantee therein.\n</p>
