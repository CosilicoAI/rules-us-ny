If such recommendation be ratified by such meeting, the\npresiding officer thereof and at least two qualified voters present\nthereat, shall execute and acknowledge a certificate setting forth such\nresolution of the vestry; the fact that notice thereof had been given\nwith the notice of the annual election, or with the notice of the\nspecial meeting, as the case may be; that such meeting had ratified the\nsame; the date determined upon for the annual election of the parish;\nthe number of vestrymen so decided on; and the fact that the meeting\ndetermined to thereafter elect churchwardens, so that the term of one\nwarden shall expire annually.
