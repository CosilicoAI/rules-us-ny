        <content>
          <p>  § 207. The number of trustees of Jewish congregations and voting by\nproxy at certain meetings thereof. A congregation of the Jewish faith\nmay at any general or special corporate meeting thereof change the\nnumber of its trustees to not more than seventy-two and classify them so\nthat the terms of one-third shall expire each year and the trustees\nelected shall hold office for three years. Whenever the number of\ntrustees in office is less than the number determined on, sufficient\nadditional trustees shall be elected to make the total number of\ntrustees equal to the number determined on. The additional trustees so\nto be elected shall be classified and hold office for such terms, not\nexceeding three years each, so that the terms of one-third of the total\nnumber of trustees shall expire each year, and thereafter for a term of\nthree years each. The right of the members of such congregation to vote\nat meetings thereof shall be fixed by its by-laws, but every member of\nsuch congregation entitled to vote at any meeting thereof may vote by\nproxy on any proposition to sell, mortgage or lease any of its property\nor for its consolidation with one or more other religious corporations\nof the Jewish faith, or, in a city having a population of one million or\nmore according to the latest federal census, in any election of trustees\nor officers. Every proxy must be executed in writing by the member\nconferring the same and shall not be given to any person other than a\nmember of the congregation. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration\nof one year from the date of its execution.  Every proxy shall be\nrevocable at the pleasure of the person executing it.\n</p>
