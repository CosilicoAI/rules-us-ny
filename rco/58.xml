          <p>  § 58. Meetings of trustees. Meetings of the trustees of such\nincorporated church shall be called by giving at least three days'\nnotice thereof in writing, served personally or by mail to all the\ntrustees, unless, by a regularly adopted standing resolution a fixed\ndate for such meeting is the approved order, in which case a written\nnotice may be dispensed with. To duly constitute such regular or special\nmeeting of the trustees for the transaction of business, at any meeting\nlawfully convened, there shall be present a majority of the laymen\ntrustees, the rector or vicar of the church, the clerk of the\ncorporation and either the bishop who is the ecclesiastical\nadministrator, the vicar-general or the chancellor of the Metropolitan\nSynod Apostolic Episcopal Church. But if the church has no rector or\nvicar, at least one of the trustees who is a warden must be present. If\neither the bishop, vicar-general or the chancellor cannot be present,\nthe bishop who is the ecclesiastical administrator may send his proxy to\none of the laymen trustees. No act or procedure other than regular\nroutine matters in regard to the administration of the temporal affairs\nof the church and for the care of the property of the corporation, as\nincluded in the budget items, shall be valid without the sanction of the\nbishop and ecclesiastical administrator of the synod or diocese to which\nthe church belongs; nor shall the trustees, without the consent of the\ncorporate meeting incur debts for items not provided in the adopted\nbudget. Trustees of such incorporated church shall have no power to\ncall, settle or remove a minister or to fix his salary; or to fix,\nchange the time, nature or order of the public or social worship, rites\nand religious observances of such church which are or shall be\nestablished by the governing ecclesiastical body.\n</p>
