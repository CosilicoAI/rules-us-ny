          <p>  § 18-101. Legislative purpose. The legislature hereby finds that\nalpine or downhill skiing is both a major recreational sport and a major\nindustry within the state of New York. The legislature further finds:\n(1) that downhill skiing, like many other sports, contains inherent\nrisks including, but not limited to, the risks of personal injury or\ndeath or property damage, which may be caused by variations in terrain\nor weather conditions; surface or subsurface snow, ice, bare spots or\nareas of thin cover, moguls, ruts, bumps; other persons using the\nfacilities; and rocks, forest growth, debris, branches, trees, roots,\nstumps or other natural objects or man-made objects that are incidental\nto the provision or maintenance of a ski facility in New York state; (2)\nthat downhill skiing, without established rules of conduct and care, may\nresult in injuries to persons and property; (3) that it is appropriate,\nas well as in the public interest, to take such steps as are necessary\nto help reduce the risk of injury to downhill skiers from undue,\nunnecessary and unreasonable hazards; and (4) that it is also necessary\nand appropriate that skiers become apprised of, and understand, the\nrisks inherent in the sport of skiing so that they may make an informed\ndecision of whether or not to participate in skiing notwithstanding the\nrisks.  Therefore, the purpose and intent of this article is to\nestablish a code of conduct for downhill skiers and ski area operators\nto minimize the risk of injury to persons engaged in the sport of\ndownhill skiing and to promote safety in the downhill ski industry.\n</p>
