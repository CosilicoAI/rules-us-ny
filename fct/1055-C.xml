At the conclusion of the review, if the court disapproves placement\nof the child in a qualified residential treatment program the court\nshall, on its own motion, determine a schedule for the return of the\nchild and direct the local social services district to make such other\narrangements for the child's care and welfare that is in the best\ninterest of the child and in the most effective and least restrictive\nsetting as the facts of the case may require. If a new placement order\nis necessary due to restrictions in the existing governing placement\norder, the court may issue a new order.\n  4.
