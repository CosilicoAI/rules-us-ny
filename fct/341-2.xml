          <p>§ 341.2. Presence of respondent and his or her parent. 1. The respondent\nand his or her counsel shall be personally present at any hearing under\nthis article and at the initial appearance.\n  2. If a respondent conducts himself or herself in so disorderly and\ndisruptive a manner that the hearing cannot be carried on with the\nrespondent in the courtroom, the court may order a recess for the\npurpose of enabling the respondent's parent or other person responsible\nfor his or her care and the respondent's counsel to exercise full\nefforts to assist the respondent to conduct himself or herself so as to\npermit the proceedings to resume in an orderly manner. If such efforts\nfail, the respondent may be removed from the courtroom if, after he or\nshe is warned by the court that he or she will be removed, he or she\ncontinues such disorderly and disruptive conduct. Such time shall not\nextend beyond the minimum period necessary to restore order.\n  3. The respondent's parent or other person responsible for his or her\ncare shall be present at any hearing under this article and at the\ninitial appearance. However, the court shall not be prevented from\nproceeding by the absence of such parent or person if reasonable and\nsubstantial effort has been made to notify such parent or other person\nand if the respondent and his or her counsel are present.\n</p>
