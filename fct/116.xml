            <p>of\nthis section shall, so far as consistent with the best interests of the\nchild, and where practicable, be applied so as to give effect to the\nreligious wishes of the birth mother, if the child is born\nout-of-wedlock, or if born in-wedlock, the religious wishes of the birth\nparents of the child, or if only one of the birth parents of an\nin-wedlock child is then living, the religious wishes of the birth\nparent then living. Religious wishes of a birth parent shall include\nwishes that the child be placed in the same religion as the birth parent\nor in a different religion from the birth parent or with indifference to\nreligion or with religion a subordinate consideration. Expressed\nreligious wishes of a birth parent shall mean those which have been set\nforth in a writing signed by the birth parent, except that, in a\nnon-agency adoption, such writing shall be an affidavit of the birth\nparent. In the absence of expressed religious wishes, as defined in this\nsubdivision, determination of the religious wishes, if any, of the birth\nparent, shall be made upon the other facts of the particular case, and,\nif there is no evidence to the contrary, it shall be presumed that the\nbirth parent wishes the child to be reared in the religion of the birth\nparent.\n</p>
