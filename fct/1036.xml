            <p>In cases involving either abuse or neglect, the court may send\nprocess without the state in the same manner and with the same effect as\nprocess sent within the state in the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nover any person subject to the jurisdiction of the court under section\nthree hundred one or three hundred two of the civil practice law and\nrules, notwithstanding that such person is not a resident or domiciliary\nof the state, where the allegedly abused or neglected child resides or\nis domiciled within the state and the alleged abuse or neglect occurred\nwithin the state. In cases involving abuse where service of a petition\nand summons upon a non-resident or non-domiciliary respondent is\nrequired, such service shall be made within ten days after its issuance.\nIf service can not be effected in ten days, an extension of the period\nto effect service may be granted by the court for good cause shown upon\napplication of any party or the child's attorney. Where service is\neffected on an out of state respondent and the respondent defaults by\nfailing to appear to answer the petition, the court may on its own\nmotion, or upon application of any party or the child's attorney proceed\nto a fact finding hearing thereon.\n</p>
