            <p>does not know which person in\nthe array is the suspect, or (ii) does not know where the suspect is in\nthe array viewed by the witness. The failure of a public servant to\nfollow such a procedure shall be assessed solely for purposes of this\narticle and shall result in the preclusion of testimony regarding the\nidentification procedure as evidence in chief, but shall not constitute\na legal basis to suppress evidence made pursuant to subdivision six of\nsection 710.20 of the criminal procedure law. This article neither\nlimits not expands subdivision six of section 710.20 of the criminal\nprocedure law.\n  2. Under circumstances prescribed in subdivision one, such witness may\ntestify at the proceeding that the person whom he or she observed and\nrecognized or whose pictorial, photographic, electronic, filmed or video\nrecorded reproduction he or she observed and recognized on the second\noccasion is the same person whom he or she observed on the first or\nincriminating occasion. Such testimony, together with the evidence that\nthe respondent is in fact the person whom the witness observed and\nrecognized or whose pictorial, photographic, electronic, filmed or video\nrecorded reproduction he or she observed and recognized on the second\noccasion, constitutes evidence in chief.\n</p>
