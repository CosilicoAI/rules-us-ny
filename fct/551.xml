Nothing in this section gives the court power\nto place or board out any child or to commit a child to an institution\nor agency. In making orders of protection, the court shall so act as to\ninsure that in the care, protection, discipline and guardianship of the\nchild his religious faith shall be preserved and protected.\n  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, an order of protection, or\ntemporary order of protection where applicable, may be entered against a\nformer spouse and persons who have a child in common, regardless of\nwhether such persons have been married or have lived together at any\ntime, or against a member of the same family or household as defined in\nsubdivision one of section eight hundred twelve of this act.\n  In any proceeding pursuant to this article, a court shall not deny an\norder of protection, or dismiss an application for such an order, solely\non the basis that the acts or events alleged are not relatively\ncontemporaneous with the date of the application or the conclusion of\nthe action. The duration of any temporary order shall not by itself be a\nfactor in determining the length or issuance of any final order.\n  The protected party in whose favor the order of protection or\ntemporary order of protection is issued may not be held to violate an\norder issued in his or her favor nor may such protected party be\narrested for violating such order.\n</p>
