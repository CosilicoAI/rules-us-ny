          <p>§ 11-1109. Registered muskrat marshes.\n  1. Applicability. A registered muskrat marsh is an enclosed marsh\nwhich was registered with the department prior to September 1 of the\nyear previous to the year in which a privilege granted or a rule\nprovided by this section is invoked or applied.\n  2. Registration. Application for registration of a muskrat marsh shall\nbe made upon forms supplied for such purpose by the department. If the\ndepartment is satisfied that the marsh covered by the application is\nbeing managed in accordance with sound management practices, it shall\nissue a certificate of registration which shall entitle registrant to\napply for the permission provided for in this section. The department\nshall be entitled to receive ten dollars as a registration fee.\n  3. Control of muskrats on registered marshes. The owner or lessee of a\nregistered marsh may apply to the department for permission to trap\nwithin specified dates during the closed season in order to allow the\nremoval of surplus muskrats, not required for breeding stock.\n  4. Investigation; permit. The department shall cause an investigation\nto be made of the allegations of all trapping applications filed with it\nby registered applicants, and may, in its discretion, issue a permit to\nsuch applicant, allowing him, and persons whom he may designate in\nwriting, to trap muskrats within specified dates during the closed\nseason, except that no such permit shall be issued for the trapping of\nmuskrats during the period from May 1 through October 31. The name and\naddress of every person designated in writing to trap shall, prior to\nthe time designee begins to trap, be forwarded by the registrant to the\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation, Albany, New York, by\nregistered mail.\n  5. Regulations. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Fish and\nWildlife Law to the contrary, the department may make regulations\ngoverning the manner of trapping muskrats on registered marshes;\nprovided, however, that no such regulations shall be made which are more\nrestrictive than provisions of this chapter expressly regulating the\nmanner of taking muskrats.\n  6. Reports. Registrants shall, not later than May 1 of each year,\nfurnish the department with a report covering the number of muskrats\ntrapped.\n  7. License. No person other than the owner or lessee thereof shall\nengage in trapping on a registered marsh unless he holds a trapping\nlicense.\n</p>
