            <p>the development of a "comprehensive plan for invasive species\nmanagement". Such plan shall address all taxa of invasive species. The\ncomprehensive plan should, at a minimum: recommend interagency\nresponsibilities; describe coordination among different agencies and\norganizations; recommend approaches to funding invasive species work;\naddress prevention, early detection and rapid response; identify\nopportunities for control and restoration, including research needs; and\ndescribe effective outreach and education. Such plan shall recommend\nresponsibilities for different agencies with the goal of reducing or\neliminating, where practicable, contradictory or conflicting policies or\nprograms. Such plan should identify needs for additional staff positions\nat state agencies and recommend New York state or federal legislation or\nregulation. Such plan shall place an emphasis on both prevention and\nearly detection and rapid response to prevent future damage. Such plan\nshall evaluate and incorporate, as appropriate: the approved New York\nState Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan; the Lake Champlain Basin\nAquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan; and the Adirondack Park\nAquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan;\n</p>
