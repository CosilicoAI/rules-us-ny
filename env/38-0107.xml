            <p>On and after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-one, no person\nrepairing or servicing motor vehicle air conditioners shall knowingly\nvent into the atmosphere the chlorofluorocarbon compounds contained in\nsuch air conditioners and shall capture for recycling or capture and\nrecycle, to the greatest extent possible, the chlorofluorocarbon\ncompounds during servicing and repair of such air conditioners by\nproperly using approved refrigerant recycling equipment provided,\nhowever, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any\nautomobile repair shop with less than four covered bays, until January\nfirst, nineteen hundred ninety-two;\n</p>

            <p>On and after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-two, no motor\nvehicle air conditioners shall be disposed of by any means without first\nhaving had the chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants contained within\nmechanical cooling systems captured for recycling. Such recapture shall\nbe performed by the person accepting the motor vehicle air conditioners\nfor recycling or dismantling. In making captured chlorofluorocarbon\ncompound refrigerants, which are captured from disposed of motor vehicle\nmobile air conditioning systems, suitable for reentry into the market\nplace, the captured chlorofluorocarbon compound refrigerants must be\nrecycled to a uniform level of quality such as that specified by the\nAir-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institution (ARI) Standard 700\n"Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants";\n</p>

In making captured\nchlorofluorocarbon compound refrigerants, which are captured from a\nrefrigeration system, suitable for reentry into the market place, the\ncaptured chlorofluorocarbon compound refrigerants must be recycled to a\nuniform level of quality such as that specified by the Air-Conditioning\nand Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Standard 700 "Specification for\nFluorocarbon Refrigerants".\n</p>

Persons wishing to purchase\nchlorofluorocarbon compounds in containers with a capacity less than\nfifteen pounds must show proof of compliance with the requirements of\nthis section.\n  2. The commissioner is hereby directed upon application by an\ninterested party to determine, after a hearing, whether any uses,\nincluding but not limited to medical uses, of chlorofluorocarbon\ncompounds and halon compounds are so necessary to human health, safety\nand welfare that they should be exempted from the application of this\nsection and section three hundred ninety-nine-t of the general business\nlaw or, upon a finding that appropriate refrigerant recycling equipment\ndoes not exist in sufficient quantities, to phase in compliance with the\nprovisions of subdivision one of this section by postponing the\ncompliance dates therein.
