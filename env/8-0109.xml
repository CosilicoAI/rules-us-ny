            <p>such other information consistent with the purposes of this\narticle as may be prescribed in guidelines issued by the commissioner\npursuant to section 8-0113 of this chapter.\n  Such a statement shall also include copies or a summary of the\nsubstantive comments received by the agency pursuant to subdivision four\nof this section, and the agency response to such comments. The purpose\nof an environmental impact statement is to provide detailed information\nabout the effect which a proposed action is likely to have on the\nenvironment, to list ways in which any adverse effects of such an action\nmight be minimized, and to suggest alternatives to such an action so as\nto form the basis for a decision whether or not to undertake or approve\nsuch action. Such statement should be clearly written in a concise\nmanner capable of being read and understood by the public, should deal\nwith the specific significant environmental impacts which can be\nreasonably anticipated and should not contain more detail than is\nappropriate considering the nature and magnitude of the proposed action\nand the significance of its potential impacts.\n  3. An agency may require an applicant to submit an environmental\nreport to assist the agency in carrying out its responsibilities,\nincluding the initial determination and, (where the applicant does not\nprepare the environmental impact statement), the preparation of an\nenvironmental impact statement under this article. The agency may\nrequest such other information from an applicant necessary for the\nreview of environmental impacts. Notwithstanding any use of outside\nresources or work, agencies shall make their own independent judgment of\nthe scope, contents and adequacy of an environmental impact statement.\n  4. As early as possible in the formulation of a proposal for an\naction, the responsible agency shall make an initial determination as to\nwhether an environmental impact statement need be prepared for the\naction.

            <p>of\nsection eighty-three of the state finance law, in order to recover all\ncosts incurred in preparing or causing to be prepared or reviewing a\ndraft environmental impact statement or an environmental impact\nstatement by employees of the department, whose salary and expenses are\npaid, in whole or in part, from the conservation fund.\n  8. When an agency decides to carry out or approve an action which has\nbeen the subject of an environmental impact statement, it shall make an\nexplicit finding that the requirements of this section have been met and\nthat consistent with social, economic and other essential\nconsiderations, to the maximum extent practicable, adverse environmental\neffects revealed in the environmental impact statement process will be\nminimized or avoided.\n  9. An environmental impact statement shall be prepared for any action\nfound to have a significant impact on the special groundwater protection\narea, as defined in section 55-0107 of this chapter. Such statement\nshall meet the requirements of the most detailed environmental impact\nstatement required by this section or by any such rule or regulation\npromulgated pursuant to this section.\n</p>
