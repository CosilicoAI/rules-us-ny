Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require that overall\nstate and federal requirements for participation of minority and\nwomen-owned business enterprises in programs authorized under this\narticle be applied without regard to local circumstances to all projects\nor in all communities.\n  2. In order to implement the requirements and objectives of this\nsection, the department and the office shall establish procedures to\nmonitor the contractors' compliance with provisions hereof, provide\nassistance in obtaining competing qualified minority and women-owned\nbusiness enterprises to perform contracts proposed to be awarded, and\ntake other appropriate measures to improve the access of minority and\nwomen-owned business enterprises to these contracts.\n</p>
