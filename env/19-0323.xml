"Best available retrofit technology" means technology, verified by\nthe United States environmental protection agency for reducing the\nemission of pollutants that achieves reductions in particulate matter\nemissions at the highest classification level for diesel emission\ncontrol strategies that is applicable to the particular engine and\napplication. Such technology shall also, at a reasonable cost, achieve\nthe greatest reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides at such\nparticulate matter reduction level and shall in no event result in a net\nincrease in the emissions of either particulate matter or nitrogen\noxides.\n  d. "Reasonable cost" means that such technology does not cost greater\nthan 30 percent more than other technology applicable to the particular\nengine and application that falls within the same classification level\nfor diesel emission control strategies, as set forth in paragraph c of\nthis subdivision, when considering the cost of the strategies,\nthemselves, ...</p>

In addition to any waiver which may be issued pursuant to\nsubdivision four of this section, the department shall issue a waiver to\na state agency, a state or regional public authority, or a person\noperating any diesel-powered heavy duty vehicle on behalf of a state\nagency, state or regional public authority, upon a request in a form\nacceptable to the department for a waiver from the provisions of\nsubdivision three of this section for a vehicle engine provided that\nsuch vehicle engine will cease to be used in the state on or before\nDecember thirty-first, two thousand twenty. Any waiver issued pursuant\nto this subdivision shall expire when a state agency, a state or\nregional public authority, or a person operating any diesel-powered\nheavy duty vehicle on behalf of a state agency, state or regional public\nauthority ceases to use the engine in the state but not later than\nDecember thirty-first, two thousand twenty.\n  6. This section shall not apply where federal law or funding precludes\nthe state from imposing the requirements of this section.\n  7. On or before January 1, 2008 and every year thereafter, the\ncommissioner shall report to the governor and legislature on the use of\nultra low sulfur diesel fuel. On or before January 1, 2020 and every\nyear thereafter, the commissioner shall include in the report to the\ngovernor and legislature the use of the best available retrofit\ntechnology as required under this section. The information contained in\nthis report shall include, but not be limited to, for each state agency\nand public authority covered by this section:</p>
