          <p>§ 55-0115. Comprehensive management plan; contents.\n  The designated planning entity shall prepare the plan for the special\ngroundwater protection area. The plan shall be designed to ensure the\nnon-degradation of the high quality of groundwater recharged within the\nspecial groundwater protection area. Where local plans already exist\nwhich effectuate the goals of this article, such local plans shall be\nevaluated and incorporated as is appropriate into the work of the\nplanning entity. Such plan shall include but not be limited to:\n  1. A determination of the quality of the existing groundwater\nrecharged through said special groundwater protection area, the natural\nrecharge capabilities of the special groundwater protection area\nwatershed and the dependence of any natural ecosystems in the special\ngroundwater protection area on the water quality and natural recharge\ncapabilities of said area;\n  2. An identification of all known existing and potential point and\nnon-point sources of groundwater degradation;\n  3. Development of specific watershed rules and regulations pursuant to\nsection eleven hundred of the public health law, which are designed to\naccomplish the purposes of this article;\n  4. A map showing the detailed boundary of the special groundwater\nprotection area or areas as well as a precise written description of\nsuch boundaries;\n  5. A resource assessment which determines the amount and type of human\ndevelopment and activity which the ecosystem can sustain while still\nmaintaining existing ground and surface water quality and protecting\nunique ecological features;\n  6. The identification and proposal of limits on federal, state and\nlocal government financially assisted activities and projects which,\ndirectly or indirectly, may contribute, in any way whatsoever, to any\ndegradation of such groundwater or any loss of natural surface and\nsubsurface infiltration or purification capability of the special\ngroundwater protection area watershed;\n  7. Development of a comprehensive statement of land use management as\nit pertains to the maintenance and enhancement of groundwater quality\nand quantity;\n  8. Proposal of limits on land uses that might have an adverse impact\non water quality and/or recharge capabilities in the special groundwater\nprotection area;\n  9. Consideration and proposal of specific techniques, including, but\nnot limited to: clustering, large lot zoning, purchase, exchange or\ndonation of conservation easements or development rights, and other\ninnovative measures sufficient to achieve the objectives of this\nsection;\n  10. Designation of specific areas within special groundwater\nprotection areas suitable and appropriate for public acquisition; and\n  11. A program for local governmental implementation of the\ncomprehensive management plan described in this subdivision in a manner\nthat will insure the continued, uniform, consistent protection of this\narea in accord with the purposes of this article.\n</p>
