In\npreparing such update, the generator shall evaluate or reevaluate the\ntechnical feasibility and economic practicability of waste reduction\nalternatives as required pursuant to subdivision four of this section\nfor each such waste, and, if appropriate, shall revise the schedule for\nimplementing technically feasible and economically practicable waste\nreduction alternatives; provided, that no evaluation or reevaluation\nshall be required for such wastes no longer produced by the generator.\nSuch update shall provide continuity with previously prepared plans.\n  6.
