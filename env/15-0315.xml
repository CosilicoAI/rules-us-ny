Appear, represent and act for the state in respect to any\nproceeding before either a federal or state governmental body or agency\nwhere the water resources of the state may be affected, and may do and\nperform such acts in connection therewith as it deems proper to protect\nthe interests of the state.\n  c. Present for the consideration of the Congress or officers of the\nfederal government, as occasion requires, the just rights of the state\nin relation to its waters and institute and prosecute appropriate\nactions and proceedings to secure such rights, and defend any action or\nproceeding calculated to impair such rights.\n  2.
