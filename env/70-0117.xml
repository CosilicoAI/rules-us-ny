            <p>Except for good cause shown by the applicant, the department may\nrequire an applicant to submit simultaneously any or all applications\nfor permits associated with a proposed project when, in the department's\njudgment, it is necessary to facilitate a comprehensive review of the\nproject.\n  2. At any time during the review of an application for a permit or a\nrequest by a permit holder for the renewal, reissuance, recertification\nor modification of an existing permit, the department may request\nadditional information from the applicant or permit holder with regard\nto any matter contained in the application or request when such\nadditional information is necessary for the department to make any\nfindings or determinations required by law. Such a request shall not\nextend any time period for department action contained in this article.\nFailure by the applicant or permit holder to provide such information\nmay be grounds for denial by the department of the application or\nrequest.\n  3. Where there is a requirement pursuant to federal law for a\ntentative determination or draft permit to be prepared prior to public\nnotice or hearing, the time within which the department shall make its\ndetermination whether or not the application is complete shall be\nextended by forty-five calendar days. This subdivision shall not apply\nto applications for state pollutant discharge elimination system permits\nfor the discharge of sewage (as defined in section 17-0105 of this\nchapter) only.\n  4. In conjunction with one or more applications for permits, the\ndepartment may, on request of an applicant undertake a conceptual review\nof a proposed project evaluating the general approvability or\nnonapprovability of a proposed project, including all proposed phases or\nsegments thereof, subject to the development and submission of more\ndetailed plans and information and such additional applications for\npermits in the future as may be necessary.
