The commissioner is hereby authorized to promulgate regulations\nrequiring manufacturers of household cleansing products distributed,\nsold or offered for sale in this state, to furnish to the commissioner\nfor the public record as herein provided information regarding such\nproducts in a form prescribed by the commissioner including the nature\nand extent of investigations and research performed by the manufacturer\nconcerning the effects of such products on human health and the\nenvironment. These reports shall be available to the public at the\ndepartment of environmental conservation, except those portions the\nmanufacturer determines, subject to the approval of the commissioner,\nwould be, if disclosed, seriously prejudicial to the manufacturer's\nlegitimate interest in trade secrets and economics of operation.\n  2. No later than February 1, 1973 the commissioner shall prepare and\nsubmit a comprehensive report to the governor and legislature on the\nstatus of progress made in research and development to provide a safe\nand effective substitute for phosphates in household cleansing products.\n  3. Whenever the commissioner finds, after investigation, that any\ningredient of household cleansing products distributed, sold, offered or\nexposed for sale in this state, other than an ingredient for which\nlimitations are set forth in subdivision 2 of section 35-0105, will or\nis likely to materially affect adversely human health or the\nenvironment, he may, after public hearing, restrict or limit by\nregulation the use of such ingredient in such products.\n</p>
