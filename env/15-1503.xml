          <p>§ 15-1503. Permits.\n  1. A permit application or request for a permit renewal or\nmodification shall be made on forms prescribed by the department and\nshall contain all information requested by the department relative to\nthe withdrawal, use and discharge of water, including:\n  a. with respect to a public water supply system, proof of adequate\nauthorization for the proposed project;\n  b. such exhibits as may be necessary clearly to indicate the scope of\nthe proposed project;\n  c. a map of any lands to be acquired;\n  d. project plans;\n  e. a statement of the need for and the reasons why the proposed source\nor sources of supply were selected among the alternative sources which\nare or may become available and the adequacy of the supply selected; and\n  f. a description of the applicant's proposed near term and long range\nwater conservation program that incorporates environmentally sound and\neconomically feasible water conservation measures, including\nimplementation and enforcement procedures, effectiveness to date and any\nplanned modifications for the future. For a public water supply system,\nthe water conservation program may include but need not be limited to:\n  i. the identification of and cost effectiveness of distribution system\nrehabilitation to correct sources of lost water;\n  ii. measures which encourage proper maintenance and water\nconservation;\n  iii. a public information program to promote water conservation,\nincluding industrial and commercial recycling and reuse;\n  iv. household conservation measures; and\n  v. contingency measures for limiting water use during seasonal or\ndrought shortages.\n  2. In making its decision to grant or deny a permit or to grant a\npermit with conditions, the department shall determine whether:\n  a. the proposed water withdrawal takes proper consideration of other\nsources of supply that are or may become available;\n  b. the quantity of supply will be adequate for the proposed use;\n  c. the project is just and equitable to all affected municipalities\nand their inhabitants with regard to their present and future needs for\nsources of potable water supply;\n  d. the need for all or part of the proposed water withdrawal cannot be\nreasonably avoided through the efficient use and conservation of\nexisting water supplies;\n  e. the proposed water withdrawal is limited to quantities that are\nconsidered reasonable for the purposes for which the water use is\nproposed;\n  f. the proposed water withdrawal will be implemented in a manner to\nensure it will result in no significant individual or cumulative adverse\nimpacts on the quantity or quality of the water source and water\ndependent natural resources;\n  g. the proposed water withdrawal will be implemented in a manner that\nincorporates environmentally sound and economically feasible water\nconservation measures; and\n  h. the proposed water withdrawal will be implemented in a manner that\nis consistent with applicable municipal, state and federal laws as well\nas regional interstate and international agreements.\n  3. In order to assist the development of local water conservation\nprograms for public water supply systems, the department shall continue\nto publish and distribute a water conservation manual that includes\nbeneficial near term and long range water conservation procedures which\nreflect local water resource needs and conditions. Such manual shall\ninclude examples of:\n  a. methods of identifying and determining the cost effectiveness of\ndistribution system rehabilitation to correct sources of lost water;\n  b. measures which encourage proper maintenance and water conservation;\n  c. a public information program to promote water conservation,\nincluding industrial and commercial recycling and reuse;\n  d. household conservation measures; and\n  e. contingency measures for limiting water use during seasonal or\ndrought shortages.\n  4. The department may grant or deny a permit or grant a permit with\nsuch conditions as may be necessary to provide satisfactory compliance\nby the applicant with the matters subject to department determination\npursuant to subdivision 2 of this section, or to bring into cooperation\nall persons that may be affected by the project, but it shall make a\nreasonable effort to meet the needs of the applicant, with due regard to\nthe actual or prospective needs, interests and rights of others that may\nbe affected by the project.\n  5. The rules and regulations adopted by the department to implement\nthis title and the provisions of article 70 of this chapter and rules\nand regulations adopted thereunder shall govern permit applications,\nrenewals, modifications, suspensions and revocations under this title.\n  6. A new permit for a water withdrawal system and any subsequent\nrenewal thereof shall be valid for a period of time not to exceed ten\nyears from the date of issuance. A new permit or permit modification\nmust be obtained from the department prior to any transfer or change of\nownership of a water withdrawal system.\n  7. For each permit issued for a public water supply system, the\ndepartment shall post on the department's website the permittee, the\nmaximum pumping capacity allowed under the permit, the results of well\nmonitoring, and the information reported pursuant to subdivision six of\nsection 15-1501 of this title.\n</p>
