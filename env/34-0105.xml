All such ordinances\nor local laws shall include a map or other identification of the erosion\nhazard area subject to regulation, and zoning regulations, subdivision\nregulations, site plan approval regulations or any other applications of\nthe police power, as such regulations may be authorized by the municipal\nhome rule law or other state enabling legislation, for the reasonable\nand prudent use of erosion hazard areas in accordance with minimum\nstandards promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to section 34-0108 of\nthis article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to increase the\npowers of any city, town or village; provided, however, that to carry\nout the purpose of this article, any regulations adopted in compliance\nwith the provisions of this subdivision may be made applicable to only\nthat portion of such city, town or village which is located within the\nerosion hazard area. The commissioner shall provide whatever technical\nassistance he may deem necessary for preparation of an ordinance or\nlocal law pursuant to this section.\n  2. Such erosion hazard area ordinance or local law shall be subject to\npublic notification and review and, be submitted to the commissioner for\napproval as to its consistency with the minimum standards promulgated\npursuant to section 34-0108 of this article; the commissioner shall act\nto approve or disapprove such ordinance or local law within thirty\nworking days of its receipt. If the commissioner disapproves the\nordinance or local law, he shall notify the city, town or village in\nwriting of the reasons for such disapproval, or modification necessary\nfor approval. The commissioner shall issue findings as part of his\ndecision.\n  3. In the case of the commissioners disapproval of a local law or\nordinance under subdivision two of this section, the commissioner, at\nhis discretion, may extend the six month period for the adoption of an\nerosion hazard area local law or ordinance for a reasonable time period\nnot to exceed an additional six months, during which time, the local\ngovernment may adopt and re-submit a new or modified local law or\nordinance to the commissioner for approval as provided in subdivision\ntwo of this section.

Any amendment to such ordinance or local law that relates to\nsuch minimum standards shall be subject to approval by the commissioner\nas provided in subdivision two of this section.\n  5. The commissioner shall revoke his approval of an erosion hazard\narea ordinance or local law if he determines, after notice and hearing\nrelative thereto, that the affected city, town or village has failed to\nadminister or enforce such ordinance or local law to adequately carry\nout the purposes and policies of this article. In the event of such\nrevocation, the provisions of subdivision seven of section 34-0106 of\nthis article or the provisions of subdivision three of section 34-0107\nof this article shall apply.\n  6.
