            <p>It is the policy of the state that the primary principle in\nmanaging the state's marine fishery resource is to maintain the\nlong-term health and abundance of marine fisheries resources and their\nhabitats, and to ensure that the resources are sustained in usable\nabundance and diversity for future generations. Utilization and\nallocation of available resources will be administered consistent with\nthe restoration and maintenance of healthy stocks and habitats. The\nstate shall actively manage its marine fisheries and shall endeavor to:\nprotect and conserve habitats; restore habitats in areas where they have\nbeen degraded; and maintain water quality at a level that will foster\noccurrence and abundance of marine resources. The state shall optimize\nthe benefits of resource use so as to provide valuable recreational\nexperiences and viable business opportunities for commercial and\nrecreational fisheries.\n</p>
