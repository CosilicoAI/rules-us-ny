All fluid draining, removal, and collection activities shall be\nconducted on asphalt or concrete surface or other surface that allows\nequivalent protections to surface and groundwater. Such surfaces shall\nbe cleaned daily, or more frequently when spillage has occurred, using\nabsorbent materials that are collected and properly disposed of.\n  3. All fluids shall be completely drained, removed, collected, and\nstored for appropriate use, treatment or disposal.\n  4. End of life vehicles arriving at the facility shall be inspected\nupon arrival for leaking fluids and unauthorized waste. Leaks should be\nremedied or contained to avoid releases of fluids to the environment.\n  5. Prior to vehicle crushing or shredding, the following potential\nenvironmental contaminants shall be drained, removed, deployed,\ncollected and/or stored, as appropriate and in accordance with best\nmanagement practices:\n</p>

            <p>air bags are deployed or removed.\n  6. Fluids shall be contained in an appropriate container for the\nspecific waste vehicle fluid. Fluids that are stored shall be placed in\nclosed containers. The containers shall be in good condition. The\ncontainers shall be clearly and legibly marked as to contents.\nContainers shall be stored on a bermed asphalt or concrete surface or\nsurface that allows equivalent protection to groundwater.\n  7. Lead acid batteries shall not be stored on the ground. All lead\nacid batteries shall be covered by a tarp or other means in a manner\nthat severely restricts water from coming into contact with the lead\nacid battery. Leaking batteries shall be stored in a leakproof container\nseparately from intact lead acid batteries and provisions shall be in\nplace to absorb any leakage.\n  8. Small PCB capacitors, mercury switches and other mercury containing\ndevices shall be stored in an appropriate labeled container for\nrecycling or disposal.\n  9. No more than one thousand waste tires off vehicles shall be stored\nat the facility at any one time unless a permit is obtained pursuant to\nthis title.\n  10. Fluids shall not be intentionally released on the ground or to\nsurface water.\n  11. Ensure the safe storage of automobiles at such facilities,\nincluding the regulation of stacking automobiles.\n  12. Access to and use of facility shall be continuously controlled by\nfencing, gates, signs, or natural barriers.\n  13. Vegetation shall be controlled to prevent encroachment into fire\naccess lanes or driveways at the facility and to decrease the potential\nof fire.\n  14. Ensure the safe handling, processing and storage of any residues,\nincluding, but not limited to, product left over after an automobile is\ncrushed and parts have been extracted, in such a manner as to prevent\noff-site migration or run-off.\n  15. Dust shall be effectively controlled so to not constitute a\nnuisance or hazard to health, safety, or property.\n  16. The fa...</p>
