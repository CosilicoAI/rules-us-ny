The department may proceed of its own motion to form such district\nand to authorize the proposed work as though petitions therefor had been\nfiled as provided in sections 15-1911 and 15-1913 or 15-1931. It may\nnegotiate with the federal government, investigate the proposed\ndistrict, study such plans of and reports on the proposed improvement as\nit may find to be available and shall prepare a written report thereon\ndescribing the proposed district, the proposed work, the fixation of the\ndistrict boundaries, giving estimates of the cost of the various parts\nof the work which may be a charge against the state or the property\nowners in the district and including a determination of enhancements and\nan apportionment of costs of such a project. Such report shall be filed\nand notice of such filing and of a hearing thereon given as provided in\nsections 15-0903, 15-1913 and 15-1931.\n  2. After the final hearing the department shall determine whether it\nis to the public interest to form the district and to proceed with the\nwork and, in general terms, what lands will be benefited thereby. These\nmatters shall be embodied in a written order, which shall, if the action\nis favorable, form the district, authorize entry into agreements with\nagencies of the federal government and the doing of whatever is needful\nto carry out the project, all as elsewhere specified in title 19 of this\narticle.  Certified copies of the determination and order shall be filed\nand notice of such filing given. Thereupon such determination may be\nreviewed as provided by section 15-0905, except that the proceedings for\nsuch review must be initiated not later than ten days after such\nfilings; otherwise such determination shall be considered final and\nconclusive and in due course it shall be recorded. The district shall be\nheld to have been formed on the date of such final order, but such\nformation shall not be effective until such order shall have been\nrecorded.\n</p>
