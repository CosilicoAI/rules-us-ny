          <p>§ 75-0105. Statewide greenhouse gas emissions report.\n  1. No later than two years after the effective date of this article,\nand each year thereafter, the department shall issue a report on\nstatewide greenhouse gas emissions, expressed in tons of carbon dioxide\nequivalents, from all greenhouse gas emission sources in the state,\nincluding the relative contribution of each type of greenhouse gas and\neach type of source to the statewide total.\n  2. The statewide greenhouse gas emissions report shall be a\ncomprehensive evaluation, informed by a variety of data, including but\nnot limited to:\n  a. information relating to the use of fossil fuels by sector,\nincluding for electricity generation, transportation, heating, and other\ncombustion purposes;\n  b. information relating to fugitive and vented emissions from systems\nassociated with the production, processing, transport, distribution,\nstorage, and consumption of fossil fuels, including natural gas;\n  c. information relating to emissions from non-fossil fuel sources,\nincluding, but not limited to, garbage incinerators, biomass combustion,\nlandfills and landfill gas generators, and anaerobic digesters;\n  d. information relating to emissions associated with manufacturing,\nchemical production, cement plants, and other processes that produce\nnon-combustion emissions; and\n  e. information from sources that may be required to participate in the\nregistration and reporting system pursuant to subdivision four of this\nsection.\n  3. The statewide greenhouse gas emissions report shall also include an\nestimate of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation of\nimported electricity and with the extraction and transmission of fossil\nfuels imported into the state which shall be counted as part of the\nstatewide total.\n  4. Within one year after the effective date of this article, the\ndepartment shall consider establishing a mandatory registry and\nreporting system from individual sources to obtain data on greenhouse\ngas emissions exceeding a particular threshold. If established, such\nregistry and reporting system shall apply a consistent reporting\nthreshold to ensure the unbiased collection of data.\n  5. The statewide greenhouse gas emissions report shall also include an\nestimate of what the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level was in\n1990.\n  6. The statewide greenhouse gas emissions report shall utilize best\navailable science and methods of analysis, including the comparison and\nreconciliation of emission estimates from all sources, fuel consumption,\nfield data, and peer-reviewed research.\n  7. The statewide greenhouse gas emissions report shall clearly explain\nthe methodology and analysis used in the department's determination of\ngreenhouse gas emissions and shall include a detailed explanation of any\nchanges in methodology or analysis, adjustments made to prior estimates,\nas needed, and any other information necessary to establish a\nscientifically credible account of change.\n  8. The department shall hold at least two public hearings to seek\npublic input regarding the methodology and analysis used in the\ndetermination of statewide greenhouse gas emissions, and periodically\nthereafter.\n</p>
