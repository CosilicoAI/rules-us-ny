            <p>accidents during transportation of low-level radioactive waste to\nsuch facilities;\n  (ii) contamination of ground or surface water by leaching and runoff\nfrom such facilities; and\n  (iii) fires or explosions from improper storage or disposal of\nvolatile, combustible, or potentially explosive materials, if any, which\nmay compose a portion of the low-level radioactive waste to be delivered\nto such facilities;\n  b. the nature of the probable environmental impacts, including the\npredictable adverse effects on the natural environment and ecology,\nscenic, historic, agricultural, cultural, and recreational values, water\nand air quality, and wildlife;\n  c. the potential for avoidance or mitigation of harm from the\nunanticipated release of low-level radioactive waste or contaminated\nmaterials;\n  d. the ability for retrieval or recovery of such waste;\n  e. differences in the density of population in the vicinity of the\npotential sites;\n  f. the adequacy of routes and means for transportation of low-level\nradioactive waste to such facilities;\n  g. the nature of the probable impact of such facilities on local\ngovernmental units within which such facilities would be located; and\n  h. the comparative economic implications, including those resulting\nfrom engineering considerations, of the potential site or sites and\ndisposal methods for such facilities.\n  8. The commission shall select one site for a permanent disposal\nfacility after consideration of all relevant public health and safety,\nenvironmental and economic factors, provided, however, that an\nadditional site may be selected if the commission finds that the use of\nan additional site presents specific advantages with respect to such\nfactors. To the extent the commission determines that different disposal\nmethods are appropriate for different categories of low-level\nradioactive waste with differing physical or chemical characteristics,\nthe commission may select more than one disposal method to...</p>

Such report or other document shall\ninclude information sufficient to permit full independent review and\nevaluation by the department, the citizen advisory committee and by an\nindependent technical and scientific evaluation panel, established\npursuant to subdivision eleven of this section, of the nature, sources,\nand quality of any specific data relied upon, the nature of assumptions\nmade, and the specific analytical methods, procedures, or techniques\nemployed, including modelling and calculations performed, and any other\ninformation and analyses upon which the commission would intend to rely\nin justifying its decisions to any reviewing body. The report shall be\nmade available to the public upon request. The commission shall\nsimultaneously have published in the state register, and send to any\nperson who has requested to be placed on the commission's mailing list,\nnotice of availability of that report or other document and provide a\ncopy of the report or other document to the governor, the speaker of the\nassembly, the majority leader of the senate, the minority leader of the\nassembly, the minority leader of the senate, the citizen advisory\ncommittee, and any independent technical and scientific evaluation panel\nestablished pursuant to subdivision eleven of this section.\n  11.
