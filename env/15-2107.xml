          <p>§ 15-2107. General duties.\n  1. Upon its organization the board may prepare a plan for the\nregulation of the flow of the river or rivers in its district. Such plan\nshall show the available and feasibile reservoir sites on such river or\nrivers, whether any reservoir now existing can be and should be enlarged\nand to what extent, the approximate number of acres of land flowed or to\nbe flowed by each reservoir, whether any of such land is owned by the\nstate and if any, how many acres, the number of acres of private land\nrequired, together with the estimated value of the land, and how many\nacres, if any, of such land are lands of the state within the forest\npreserve. Such acreage shall include such quantity of land surrounding\nthe reservoir to be created or enlarged as would in the judgment of the\nboard be required for the protection, maintenance and operation of such\nreservoir. The plan shall be accompanied by such maps, profiles and\nother data and descriptions as may be necessary to set forth properly\nthe location and character of the work and of the property to be taken\nor damaged, and by estimates of cost of each such reservoir. In case\nmaps, plans and specifications for any such reservoir at or near the\nsite thereof, are on file in the office of the department, and in case\nany records in any other department of the state government would be an\naid in the preparation of such plans, these shall be available to the\nboard for such purpose.\n  2. Upon the completion of such plan if the board approves of such plan\nit shall certify it to the department for its approval, and the\ndepartment within forty days thereafter may approve the same, or modify\nit and approve it as so modified. As so approved by the department it\nshall be known as the "official plan" for the regulation of the flow of\nthe river or rivers of the district. Copies thereof shall be filed in\nthe offices of the board, the department, and of the county clerk of\neach county wholly or partly within the district. Such plan in like\nmanner may be altered from time to time provided such alteration shall\nnot affect any assessment already made.\n</p>
