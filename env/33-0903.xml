That any statement in the application or upon which the permit was\nissued, is or was false or misleading;\n  b. That the applicant or permit holder failed to justify his need for\nthe quantity and types of restricted use pesticides requested;\n  c. That the applicant or permit holder stored, applied, used or\ndisposed of any pesticide contrary to the registered labeled usage or\ncontrary to the conditions specified in his permit;\n  d. That the applicant or permit holder has failed to comply with any\nprovisions of this article or rules and regulations of the department\nmade pursuant thereto; or\n  e. That the applicant or permit holder has failed to demonstrate that\nhe has sufficient knowledge and experience concerning the proper use,\napplication and disposal of pesticides.\n  5. A formal hearing shall not be required and the commissioner's\ndecision in denying or revoking a permit shall be final unless the\napplicant or permit holder institutes a review within the time and in\nthe manner prescribed by article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.\n  6. The commissioner is authorized to exempt holders of a pesticide\napplicator certification from the requirement of obtaining a purchase\npermit as provided for herein.
