          <p>§ 15-2321. River improvement district with federal aid.\n  1. In the event that any agency of the government of the United States\nshall be willing to perform, direct or finance any work for the\nimprovement of a river, as specified in title 23 of this article, in\nsuch manner that the greater part of the cost of such work shall be paid\nby such government, the department shall have power to form a river\nimprovement district covering the areas to be benefited by such work by\nfollowing the procedure set forth in this section, in lieu of the\nprocedure specified in the preceding sections of title 23 of this\narticle.\n  2. The department may proceed of its own motion to form such district\nand to authorize the proposed work as though a petition therefor had\nbeen filed as provided in section 15-2303. It may negotiate with the\nfederal government, investigate the proposed district and prepare a\nwritten report thereon, describing the proposed district and the\nproposed works, and giving estimates of the cost of the various parts of\nthe work which may be a charge against the proposed district. Such\nreport shall be filed and notice of such filing and of a hearing thereon\ngiven as provided in section 15-2303, except that the period of notice\nprovided for in section 15-2303 shall be halved. After the final hearing\nthe department shall determine whether it is in the public interest to\nform the district and to proceed with the work and in general terms,\nwhat public corporations and lands will be benefited thereby.  These\nmatters shall be embodied in a written order, which shall, if the action\nis favorable, contain orders to make surveys, assessments, enter into\nagreements with agencies of the federal government, acquire lands and\nrights in lands and all other matters which may be needful for the\ncarrying out of the proposed project. Such written order shall state\nwhether it is planned to issue obligations pursuant to the Local Finance\nLaw. Certified copies of the determination and order shall be filed and\nnotice of such filing given. Such determination and order may be\nreviewed pursuant to section 15-0905, but application for review must be\nmade within ten days after such filing. If no review is had, the\ndepartment shall cause the same to be recorded. The district shall be\nheld to have been formed on the date of such final order, but such\nformation shall not be effective until such order, as made or as\nmodified on review, shall have been recorded.\n  3. As soon as the formation of the district becomes effective, the\ndepartment shall have full power to enter into agreements with the\nproper officials of the federal government or of other agencies of the\nstate, to acquire or to appropriate lands and rights in lands, including\nsites for camps and appurtenant facilities, access roads, borrow pits,\nquarries, spoil banks and all necessary and proper matters, to incur\ncontractual obligations, to employ the necessary personnel and generally\nto do whatever is necessary to carry out the proposed project or\nprojects.\n  4. After such district is formed and the original federal project\nauthorized, major changes in such project, additional federal projects,\nchanges in district boundaries necessitated by such federal projects or\nthe raising of required additional funds for the work may be authorized\nby following the pertinent portions of the procedure in section 15-2303\nabove.\n  5. Except for such projects as may be carried out by the federal\ngovernment, any district formed under the provisions of subdivision 2\nabove shall thereafter continue as a river improvement district, as\nthough formed under the provisions of section 15-2303.\n</p>
