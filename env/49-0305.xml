            <p>Any conservation easement created pursuant to this title shall not\nlimit, restrict or modify the right to construct, operate or continue\nthe use of any facility, or impede any activity, duly authorized under\nthe applicable provisions of the federal natural gas act (15 U.S.C. §§\n717-717 w).\n  4. A conservation easement shall be duly recorded and indexed as such\nin the office of the recording officer for the county or counties where\nthe land is situate in the manner prescribed by article nine of the real\nproperty law. The easement shall describe the property encumbered by the\neasement by adequate legal description or by reference to a recorded map\nshowing its boundaries and bearing the seal and signature of a licensed\nland surveyor, or if the easement encumbers the entire property\ndescribed in a deed of record, the easement may incorporate by reference\nthe description in such deed, otherwise it shall refer to the liber and\npage of the deed or deeds of the record owner or owners of the real\nproperty burdened by the conservation easement. An instrument for the\npurpose of creating, conveying, modifying or terminating a conservation\neasement shall not be effective unless recorded. A person causing any\nsuch document to be so recorded shall forthwith forward a copy thereof\nto the department, which shall maintain a file of conservation\neasements.\n  5. A conservation easement may be enforced in law or equity by its\ngrantor, its holder or by a public body or any not-for-profit\nconservation organization designated in the easement as having a third\nparty enforcement right, and is enforceable against the owner of the\nburdened property. Enforcement shall not be defeated because of any\nsubsequent adverse possession, laches, estoppel or waiver.
