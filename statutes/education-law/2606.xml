          <p>  § 2606. Registration of voters. 1. The board of education except in\nthose city school districts which have adopted a resolution pursuant to\nsection twenty-five hundred thirty-one of this chapter, shall, on or\nbefore the fifteenth day of February in each year, appoint a board of\nregistration for a term of one year, consisting of as many members as\nthe board shall deem necessary, not more than half of whom shall belong\nto the same political party, and shall designate a place within the city\nschool district where such board of registration shall attend for the\npurpose of preparing a register for each school election district. Each\nmember of the board of registration shall be entitled to compensation at\na rate not to exceed that paid at general elections in the city.\n  2. The board of registration of such city school district shall meet\nat the designated place for the purpose of preparing the registers for\nsuch election on such day or days as shall be fixed by the board of\neducation, the last day of which, however, shall not be less than two\nweeks preceding each school election, at such hours as the board of\neducation shall by resolution designate at least twenty days before the\nfirst registration day, which hours shall include at least four hours\nbetween seven o'clock in the morning and eight o'clock in the evening.\nThe registers shall, so far as practicable, be in the same form as the\nregister of voters in an election district for a general election in a\ncity or village having five thousand inhabitants or more, under the\nelection law. Such registers shall be arranged alphabetically by the\nfirst letter of surnames, and the place of residence by street and\nnumber, or by a description accurately locating such place of residence,\nof each person entered in such registers shall be given.\n  Notwithstanding any other general or special law, the board of\nregistration shall have the power to require the board of elections or\nother authority having lawful custody of the register or registers used\nat the general elections last preceding such school election to turn\nover such register or registers to such board of registration on or\nbefore March first of each year for use on the date or dates of such\nregistration and election, for the purpose of preparing the school\ndistrict registers therefrom. Such board of elections or other authority\nmay, however, elect to furnish, in place of the original registers\neither a duplicate of the central file registration records, or a list\nof registered voters, certified to be a complete and accurate copy of\nthe names and addresses of all persons entered in such register for the\nlast preceding general election as well as the names of persons who have\nregistered with such board of elections or other authority up to five\ndays before the date of furnishing such list. On the day following the\nday of the election, the general election register or registers shall be\nreturned to the authority from whom such register or registers were\nsecured. In addition, the board of registration shall include in each\nschool district register, the names and addresses of persons who\nregistered for any intervening school district election, but who were\nnot registered for the preceding general election. The board of\nregistration shall, for each election of the school district, add to\nsuch registers the names of the qualified voters of the school district\nwho shall present themselves personally for registration. Only those\nqualified voters who are not registered under permanent personal\nregistration on or before the last registration day found on the\noriginal or duplicate registers or records or list furnished by the\nboard of elections and have not voted at an intervening school district\nelection, shall be required to present themselves personally for\nregistration.\n  3. All the provisions of the election law in relation to the\nregistration of voters in a city or village having five thousand\ninhabitants or more, shall so far as practicable and consistent with the\nprovisions of this article, apply to the registration provided for in\nthis section.\n  4. The district clerk shall furnish the necessary registration\nmaterial to the board of registration at the expense of the school\ndistrict.\n  5. The board of education shall publish a notice of registration at\nleast once in each of the two weeks preceding the first registration day\ndesignated, in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city\nschool district; or, at least two weeks preceding the first registration\nday designated, the board shall post a printed copy of the notice\nconspicuously in twenty places frequented by the public within such\ndistrict. Such notice shall state that at a place and hour or hours at\nwhich the board of registration shall meet to prepare the school\nelection district registers, any person who has not currently registered\nunder permanent personal registration by the last date found on such\noriginal or duplicate registers, or records, or list furnished by the\nboard of elections, and has not voted at an intervening election, must,\nin order to be entitled to vote, present himself personally for\nregistration. Such notice shall state the last date found on such\noriginal or duplicate registers or records or list furnished by the\nboard of elections.\n  6. The registers prepared as provided in this section shall,\nimmediately upon completion and not less than two weeks prior to the\ntime set for the school election at which they are to be used, be filed\nin the office of the clerk of the board of education, and thereafter\nshall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any qualified\nvoter of the school district. Upon the filing of such registers, the\nboard of education shall publish at least once in each of the two weeks\npreceding such election in a newspaper having a general circulation in\nthe city school district, or shall post conspicuously in twenty places\nfrequented by the public within the school district, a notice stating\nthat the school election district registers have been filed and noting\nthe place at which they are on file and the hours during which they will\nbe open for inspection in each day up to the day set for the election.\n  7. Any person who is duly qualified to vote and who registered for the\npreceding general election or any intervening school district election,\nand whose name was by mistake, error or neglect of the board of\nregistration, omitted from the school election district register, may at\nany time either before or during election day request the clerk of the\nboard of education to place the name of such voter on the appropriate\nregister. If the clerk of the board of education shall find that such an\nomission has been made, he shall place the voter's name on the register.\nIn the event of the failure, refusal or neglect of the clerk of the\nboard of education to comply with such request, a court, justice or\njudge in a proceeding instituted by such voter may grant an order\ncompelling such clerk forthwith to enter the voter's name on the\nregister.\n  8. A qualified voter may, upon the examination of the registers, file\na challenge of the qualifications as a voter of any person whose name\nappears on such registers. Such challenges shall be written, shall be\nunder oath and shall be on blanks to be furnished by the board of\neducation.\n  9. Challenges shall be received and preserved by the clerk of the\nboard or other person designated by the board, and upon receipt thereof,\nthe clerk shall file such challenge or copy thereof with the register,\nand shall place the words "to be challenged on the day of election"\nopposite the name of such person on the register.\n  10. The clerk of the board of education shall cause a copy of the\nappropriate register of such school district to be delivered on the day\nof the election before the opening of the polls to the inspectors of\nelection at each voting place within the district at the place or places\nwhere the election is to be held.\n  11. School elections in any school district subject to the provisions\nof this article, shall hereafter be conducted in the manner provided in\nthis article, and no person shall be entitled to vote whose name does\nnot appear upon the register of the school election district in which he\nclaims to be entitled to vote.\n  Any person who has moved from one school election district to another,\nin the same city school district and who has not registered in the new\nschool election district, and who is still registered in the district\nfrom which he moved, may vote in the election district in which he is\nregistered. Such person must at the time of voting advise the election\ninspectors of his new address and they shall advise the board of\nregistration to correct such registration.\n  12. The provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to any\nperson registered to vote pursuant to the provisions of section three\nhundred fifty-two of the election law.\n</p>
