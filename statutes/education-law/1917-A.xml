In any case in which a component district sends students to a\ncentral high school district, each teacher and all other employees\npreviously employed in the education of such students by such component\ndistrict prior to the time that such component district sends its\nstudents to a central high school district shall be considered employees\nof such central high school district, with the same tenure status held\nin such component district.\n  For purposes of this section, when a component district takes back\nstudents that it sent to another district on a tuition basis and sends\nsuch students to a central high school district, such central high\nschool district shall be deemed the "sending district" for purposes of\nthe rights and protections provided in section three thousand fourteen-c\nof this chapter.\n  4. If the number of teaching and other positions needed to provide the\neducational services required by such central high school district is\nless than the number of teachers and other employees eligible to be\nconsidered employees of such central high school district as provided by\nsubdivision three of this section, the services of the teachers and\nother employees having the least seniority in the component district\nwithin the tenure area of the position shall be discontinued.
