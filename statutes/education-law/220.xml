Such petition shall be duly verified and shall set\nforth a complete statement of all the assets, together with their\nlocation and an estimate of their value, and also a statement of the\nascertainable debts of the corporation.\n  2. Such petition shall be accompanied by proof that notice of the time\nand place of such intended application to said court has been duly\npublished once in each week for at least four weeks successively, next\npreceding such application, in a newspaper circulated in the county\nwhere such corporation is located.\n  3. A copy of such petition shall be served upon the regents and the\nattorney general not less than ten days prior to such application.\n  4. The court shall direct the sale of sufficient designated assets to\npay any outstanding debts and the cost of dissolution.
