The results of such examination\nshall be promptly forwarded to the school authorities. If it should be\nascertained, upon such test or examination, that any child is making use\nof dangerous drugs, the school authorities shall report same to the\nsocial services department for the social services district wherein such\nschool is located and to the parent of, or person in parental relation\nto, such child together with a statement to such parent or person in\nparental relation as to available programs and facilities to combat such\ndangerous drug usage. The local social services department shall be\nempowered, in an appropriate case, to take such action and offer such\nprotective social services as are prescribed by title six of article six\nof the social services law.\n  3. Except as required in this section, information resulting from an\nexamination conducted pursuant to this section shall be kept\nconfidential and shall not be used for law enforcement purposes but may\nbe utilized only for statistical, epidemiological or research purposes.\n  4. Any record or information compiled from such examination which\nidentifies an individual student as a user of dangerous drugs shall be\nmaintained separate and apart from such student's other educational\nrecords and in appropriate confidence and shall be destroyed upon such\nstudent's graduation or final severance from the secondary educational\nschool system in this state.\n  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, no such\nexamination shall be required where a student objects thereto on the\ngrounds that such examinations conflict with their genuine and sincere\nreligious beliefs.\n</p>
