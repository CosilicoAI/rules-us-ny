          <p>  § 3624. Drivers, monitors and attendants. The commissioner shall\ndetermine and define the qualifications of drivers, monitors and\nattendants and shall make the rules and regulations governing the\noperation of all transportation facilities used by pupils which rules\nand regulations shall include, but not be limited to, a maximum speed of\nfifty-five miles per hour for school vehicles engaged in pupil\ntransportation that are operated on roads, interstates or other\nhighways, parkways or bridges or portions thereof that have posted speed\nlimits in excess of fifty-five miles per hour, prohibitions relating to\nsmoking, eating and drinking and any and all other acts or conduct which\nwould otherwise impair the safe operation of such transportation\nfacilities while actually being used for the transport of pupils. The\nemployment of each driver, monitor and attendant shall be approved by\nthe chief school administrator of a school district for each school bus\noperated within his or her district. For the purpose of determining his\nor her physical fitness, each driver, monitor and attendant may be\nexamined on order of the chief school administrator by a duly licensed\nphysician within two weeks prior to the beginning of service in each\nschool year as a school bus driver, monitor or attendant. The report of\nthe physician, in writing, shall be considered by the chief school\nadministrator in determining the fitness of the driver to operate or\ncontinue to operate any transportation facilities used by pupils and in\ndetermining the fitness of any monitor or attendant to carry out his or\nher functions on such transportation facilities. Nothing in this section\nshall prohibit a school district from imposing a more restrictive speed\nlimit policy for the operation of school vehicles engaged in pupil\ntransportation than the speed limit policy established by the\ncommissioner.\n</p>
