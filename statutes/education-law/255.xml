Upon the request of a majority of the members of the boards of\ntrustees of two or more libraries chartered by the regents, if it shall\nappear to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the establishment of\na cooperative library system will result in improved and expanded\nlibrary service to the area and that the area is suitable for the\nestablishment of such a cooperative library system, the commissioner may\ncall a joint meeting of the trustees of such libraries for the purpose\nof determining whether a cooperative library system shall be established\nand electing a board of trustees of such cooperative library system. If\nit shall appear to the commissioner that the area proposed for the\ncooperative library system is not sufficient to warrant the\nestablishment of such system; that such area is not otherwise suitable\nor that for sufficient other reason such cooperative library system as\nproposed should not be established he shall disapprove such request.\n  a.
