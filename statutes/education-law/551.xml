          <p>  § 551. Apportionment. 1. In order to meet proper health, welfare and\nsafety standards in qualifying schools for the benefit of the pupils\nenrolled therein, there shall be apportioned health, welfare and safety\ngrants by the commissioner to each qualifying school for the school\nyears beginning on and after July first, nineteen hundred seventy-one,\nan amount equal to the product of thirty dollars multiplied by the\naverage daily attendance of pupils receiving instruction in such school,\nto be applied for costs of maintenance and repair. Such apportionment\nshall be increased by ten dollars multiplied by the average daily\nattendance of pupils receiving instruction in a school building\nconstructed prior to nineteen hundred forty-seven. In no event shall the\nper pupil annual allowance computed under this section exceed fifty per\ncentum of the average per pupil cost of equivalent maintenance and\nrepair in the public schools of the state on a state-wide basis, as\ndetermined by the commissioner, and in no event shall the apportionment\nto a qualifying school exceed the amount of expenditures for maintenance\nand repair of such school as reported pursuant to section five hundred\nfifty-two of this article.\n  2. The apportionment pursuant to this section shall be reduced by one\none hundred eightieth for each day less than one hundred eighty days\nthat such school was actually in total session in the base year, except\nthat the commissioner may disregard such reduction up to five days if he\nfinds that the school was not in session for one hundred eighty days\nbecause of extraordinary adverse weather conditions, impairment of\nheating facilities, insufficiency of water supply, shortage of fuel or\nthe destruction of a school building, and if the commissioner further\nfinds that such school cannot make up such days of instruction during\nthe school year. No such reduction shall be made, however, for any day\non which such school was in session for the purpose of administering the\nregents examinations or the regents scholarship examinations, or any\nday, not to exceed three days, when such school was not in session\nbecause of a conference of teachers called by the principal of the\nschool.\n</p>
