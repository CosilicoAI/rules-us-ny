        <content>
          <p>  * § 2022-a. Disaster; additional day for voting. 1. Upon request of a\nschool district, or upon the determination of the commissioner, the\ncommissioner may provide for an additional day of voting for the annual\nmeeting and election if they determine that less than eight percent of\nqualified voters voted as a direct consequence of a disaster. For the\npurposes of this section, "disaster" shall include events such as a\nfire, earthquake, tornado, explosion, power failure, act of sabotage,\nenemy attack or other event that results in substantial damage to\nproperty or the possible or actual loss of life. The procedures\napplicable to a school's annual meeting and election shall thereafter be\nfollowed as far as applicable and practicable.\n  2. Such additional day of voting shall be held between seven and\nfourteen days after the original annual meeting and election, provided\nthat when the commissioner determines it would not be feasible to hold\nthe additional day of voting within fourteen days, they may authorize\nthe district to schedule such additional day of voting as soon as may be\nfeasible; provided, further, that where a disaster occurs on the date of\na school budget revote pursuant to either section two thousand\ntwenty-three-a or two thousand seven of this part, the district shall\nhold an additional day of voting no sooner than five days after the\nschool budget revote, but no later than the last day of the month of\nJune. The board of education shall determine the hours during which the\npolls shall remain open on such additional day for voting; provided,\nhowever, that in any event the polls shall remain open for not less than\neleven hours.\n  3. The commissioner shall notify the board of education and county\nboard of elections of such date. The clerk of the school district shall\npublish notice of the date of the additional day of voting not less than\ntwice in each week preceding the date for the additional day for voting,\nin two newspapers having general circulation within such district if\nthere are two, or in one newspaper if there is only one and notify all\nqualified voters by mail. Such notice shall also direct attention to any\nchange of polling places, the original notice of disaster determination\nfrom the commissioner, and contain such other and additional information\nas in the judgment of the board of education shall be necessary and\nproper. The notice of the date of the additional day of voting shall be\nmade available on the school district's website, if one exists.\n  4. Official ballots shall be provided at public expense at each\npolling place for such additional day of voting. In any election\ndistrict in which voting machines were used upon the original day of\nvoting, they shall be used for the additional day for voting. The\noriginal seal on such machines shall not be removed nor shall the\nmachines be unlocked until the opening of the polls on the additional\nday for voting and the board of elections shall provide an additional\nseal to be used as soon as the polls are closed on such day. County\nboards of elections which have provided voting machines to school\ndistricts for original days of voting shall continue to provide such\nvoting machines until the additional day of voting is complete.\n  5. Only those persons qualified to vote upon the original date of the\nschool district's annual meeting and election who did not vote on such\ndate shall be entitled to vote on the additional day for voting. Voting\non the additional day provided for in this section shall be accomplished\nsolely by physically appearing at the polling place, and nothing\ncontained in this section shall be construed to extend the time set by\nlaw for casting or canvassing an absentee, military, or special ballot;\nprovided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to\ninvalidate any absentee, military, or special ballot duly received on\nthe original date of the annual meeting and election. Such additional\nday of voting shall not be considered a resubmission of such item to the\nvoters.\n  * NB Effective July 1, 2026\n</p>
