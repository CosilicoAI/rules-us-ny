As approved by the\nregents, such modification shall be made a part of the respective plans\nof the state university and of the city university and shall, together\nwith any modifications the regents may make to that portion of their\nplan for the development of higher education in the state not\ncomprehended in the plans of the state and city universities, be\ntransmitted to the governor and the legislature, all of which shall then\nbecome effective upon approval by the governor as modifications of the\nregents plan. By the first day of November in nineteen hundred\nseventy-four and each fourth year thereafter the regents shall summarize\nand report to the governor and the legislature any modifications made\npursuant to this subdivision and shall include in such report a\nstatement on the progress made in implementing the regents plan and\ntheir general recommendations with respect to higher education.\n  7.
