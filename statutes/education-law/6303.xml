          <p>  § 6303. Programs and curricula of community colleges. 1. Community\ncolleges shall provide two-year programs of post high school nature\ncombining general education with technical education relating to the\noccupational needs of the community, area or community college region in\nwhich the college is located and those of the state and the nation\ngenerally. Special courses and extension work may be provided for\npart-time students.\n  2. Training for certain occupational skills may be limited to selected\ncommunity colleges by the state university trustees in order to avoid\nunnecessary duplication or overlapping of facilities and programs.\n  3. The curricula in community colleges shall be designed to serve the\nneeds of students who seek two years of post secondary education and\nwhose needs would not ordinarily be met by the usual four-year college\ncurriculum. However, such colleges shall nevertheless provide sufficient\ngeneral education to enable qualified students who so desire to transfer\nafter completion of the community college program to institutions\nproviding regular four-year courses except that the provision of such\ngeneral education sufficient for transfer to institutions providing\nregular four-year courses shall be at the option of the local sponsor in\nany of the community colleges established upon discontinuance of a state\ninstitute of applied arts and sciences and upon discontinuance of the\nveterans vocational school at Troy pursuant to the provisions of section\nfifty-nine hundred nine of former article one hundred nineteen of this\nchapter.\n  4. The curricula of the community colleges shall be developed with the\nassistance and guidance of the state university trustees and shall be\nsubject to their approval, and such modifications, amendments and\nrevisions as they may from time to time prescribe.\n  5. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other general, special or\nlocal law, rule or regulation, community colleges may permit persons\nsixty years of age or over to audit courses given therein without\ntuition, examination, grading or credit therefor upon a space available\nbasis, subject to the provisions of section sixty-three hundred four of\nthis chapter, as determined by the president of each such institution,\nprovided that such audit attendance does not deny course attendance at a\ncommunity college by an individual who is otherwise qualified under the\nregulations and the provisions of section sixty-three hundred four of\nthis chapter. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect any\nstate aid to community colleges granted pursuant to article one hundred\ntwenty-six of this chapter.\n  6. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other general, special or\nlocal law, rule or regulation, each community college, or the entity or\nentities responsible for setting tuition at such institution, shall be\nauthorized to set a reduced rate of tuition and/or fees, or to waive\ntuition and/or fees entirely, for students participating in any dual or\nconcurrent enrollment program with no reduction in other state, local,\nor other support for such students earning college credit that such\nhigher education partner would otherwise be eligible to receive;\nprovided that, for purposes of this provision, a dual or concurrent\nenrollment program shall mean one or more college courses taken by a\nhigh school student through a community college while such student is\nstill enrolled in high school or boards of cooperative educational\nservices and for which the student may receive both high school and\ncollege credit.\n</p>
