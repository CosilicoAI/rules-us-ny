The board of education of such school district shall make a\nreport at the annual meeting of such school district, of matters\nrelating to carrying out the provisions of this section.\n  2. Any such school district is hereby authorized to appropriate in the\nmanner prescribed by law relating to such school district such sums as\nmay be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this\nsection. Money shall be paid out of the treasury of such school district\nin the manner provided by law.\n  3.
