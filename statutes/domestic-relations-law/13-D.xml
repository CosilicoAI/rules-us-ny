          <p>  § 13-d. Duty of clerk issuing marriage license. 1. It shall be the\nduty of each town and each city clerk or duly authorized deputy acting\nin the clerk's stead, upon the issuance of a marriage license to display\nto the parties a typed or printed statement containing substantially the\nsame following information:\n  "Rubella, also known as 'German measles', is a common childhood\ndisease.  It is usually not serious to children who contract it\nthemselves, but can be a tragic crippler of unborn babies if transmitted\nto pregnant women.\n  Rubella infection poses a grave threat to the unborn child, especially\nduring the first four months of pregnancy. It can lead to miscarriage,\nstillbirth, or one or all of the tragic defects such as deafness,\nblindness, crippling congenital heart disease, developmental disability\nand muscular and bone defects.\n  In order to be immune to rubella, one must either receive the rubella\nvaccine or actually have had the disease. To see whether you are\nsusceptible to rubella, you can get a blood test from your doctor. Even\nmore important is the availability of a rubella vaccine which will\nprevent you from ever contracting the disease.\n  In order to protect yourself, your family, and your friends, please\ntake steps to prevent the tragic effects of rubella. Please contact your\nfamily doctor, health care provider, public health facility or clinic\nfor further information."\n  2. It shall also be the duty of each town and city clerk or duly\nauthorized deputy acting in the clerk's stead to provide to each\napplicant for a marriage license information regarding the Thalassemia\nTrait. The department of health shall prepare information, including but\nnot limited to, the blood disorder Thalassemia Trait and other inherited\nconditions affecting the population of New York state.\n  3. No cause of action for damages shall arise in favor of any person\nor person yet to be born by reason of any failure to comply with the\nprovisions of this section.\n</p>
