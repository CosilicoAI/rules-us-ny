If either party to the marriage resides\nupon an island located not less than twenty-five miles from the office\nor residence of the town clerk of the town of which such island is a\npart, and if such office or residence is not on such island such license\nmay be obtained from any justice of the peace residing on such island,\nand such justice, in respect to powers and duties relating to marriage\nlicenses, shall be subject to the provisions of this article governing\ntown clerks and shall file all statements or affidavits received by him\nwhile acting under the provisions of this section with the town clerk of\nsuch town. No application for a marriage license shall be denied on the\nground that the parties are of the same, or a different, sex.\n</p>
