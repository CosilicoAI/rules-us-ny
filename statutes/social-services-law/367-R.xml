            <p>In\naddition, the commissioner shall further increase rates for private duty\nnursing services that are provided to medically fragile children to\nensure the availability of such services to such children. Furthermore,\nno later than sixty days after the effective date of the chapter of the\nlaws of two thousand twenty-two that amended this subdivision, increased\nrates shall be extended for private duty nursing services provided to\nmedically fragile adults. In establishing rates of payment under this\nsubdivision, the commissioner shall consider the cost neutrality of such\nrates as related to the cost effectiveness of caring for medically\nfragile children and medically fragile adults in a non-institutional\nsetting as compared to an institutional setting. Medically fragile\nchildren shall, for the purposes of this subdivision, have the same\nmeaning as in subdivision three-a of section thirty-six hundred fourteen\nof the public health law. For purposes of this subdivision, "medically\nfragile adult" shall be defined as including but not limited to any\nindividual who previously qualified as a medically fragile child but no\nlonger meets the age requirement. Such increased rates for services\nrendered to such children and adults may take into consideration the\nelements of cost, geographical differentials in the elements of cost\nconsidered, economic factors in the area in which the private duty\nnursing service is provided, costs associated with the provision of\nprivate duty nursing services to medically fragile children and\nmedically fragile adults, and the need for incentives to improve\nservices and institute economies and such increased rates shall be\npayable only to those private duty nurses who can demonstrate, to the\nsatisfaction of the department of health, satisfactory training and\nexperience to provide services to such children and medically fragile\nadults. Such increased rates shall be determined based on application of\nthe case mix adjustment ...</p>
