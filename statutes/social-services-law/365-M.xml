            <p>Pursuant to appropriations within the offices of mental health\nor addiction services and supports, the department of health shall\nreinvest savings realized through the transition of populations covered\nby this section from the applicable Medicaid fee-for-service system to a\nmanaged care model, including savings realized through the recovery of\npremiums from managed care providers which represent a reduction of\nspending on qualifying behavioral health services against established\npremium targets for behavioral health services and the medical loss\nratio applicable to special needs managed care plans, for the purpose of\nincreasing investment in community based behavioral health services,\nincluding residential services certified by the office of addiction\nservices and supports. The methodologies used to calculate the savings\nshall be developed by the commissioner of health and the director of the\nbudget in consultation with the commissioners of the office of mental\nhealth and the office of addiction services and supports. In no event\nshall the full annual value of the reinvestment pursuant to this\nsubdivision exceed the value of the premiums recovered from managed care\nproviders which represent a reduction of spending on qualifying\nbehavioral health services. Within any fiscal year where appropriation\nincreases are recommended for reinvestment, insofar as managed care\ntransition savings do not occur as estimated, then spending for such\nreinvestment may be reduced in the next year's annual budget\nitemization.\n</p>
