No allowance shall\nbe made for any excess in width of less than twenty-two inches.\n  2. In a building erected before October first, nineteen hundred\nthirteen, fourteen persons for every eighteen inches in width of\nstairway provided for such floor and conforming to the requirements for\nrequired exits except as to extension to the roof. For any excess in\nwidth of less than eighteen inches, a proportionate increase in the\nnumber of occupants shall be allowed. If a stairway has winders a\ndeduction of ten per centum shall be made in computing the capacity of\nsuch stairway.\n  3. On any floor which is more than ten feet from the one immediately\nbeneath, the number "fourteen" allowed in subdivisions one and two may\nbe increased respectively by one person for every sixteen inches over\nten feet between the two floors provided such stairways conform to the\nrequirements for required exits except as to extension to the roof.\n  4.
