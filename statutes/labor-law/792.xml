        <content>
          <p>  § 792. Entering into a call center contract. 1. Whenever a\ngovernmental body shall undertake to procure call center services using\na call center contractor, the governmental body may require that the\ncall center contract with such entity includes the obligation pursuant\nto this article to retain call center employees of the former call\ncenter contractor.\n  2. A governmental body intending to enter into a call center service\ncontract, in circumstances in which such services had theretofore been\nperformed by call center employees pursuant to a call center contract,\nmay require any entity seeking to enter into such contract to\ndemonstrate that it will establish the worksite for its performance in a\nlocation which is reasonably accessible to the employees who have been\nperforming such services prior to the solicitation of bids for a\nsuccessor call center contract. For the purposes of this section, a\nworksite shall be considered reasonably accessible if it is 10 miles or\nless from the location of the affected employees' worksite where such\nemployees performed work-related duties in the course of their\nemployment for the former call center contractor, provided that any\nworksite shall not include an employee's domicile, permanent or\ntemporary, where an employee performs any work-related duty in the\ncourse of their employment. The requirements of this subdivision shall\nnot apply to successor call center contractors that intend for the\nwork-related duties of the affected call center employees previously\nemployed by the former call center contractor to be performed remotely.\n</p>
