Before payment is made by or on behalf of a public agency of any\nsums due on account of a contract for service work and representing the\nfinal portion of twenty percent of the total consideration payable under\nthe contract, it shall be the duty of the comptroller of the state or\nthe financial officer of such public agency or other officer or person\ncharged with the custody and disbursement of the state or corporate\nfunds applicable to the contract under and pursuant to which payment is\nmade to require the contractor to file every verified statement required\nto be obtained by the contractor from its subcontractors pursuant to\nsubdivision one of this section and to file a statement in writing in\nform satisfactory to such officer setting forth the amounts known by the\ncontractor to be then due and owing from a subcontractor, or from a\nsubcontractor of such subcontractor, for such wages and supplements, or\ncertifying that the contractor has no knowledge of such amounts owing to\nor on behalf of any service employees of its subcontractors, and that in\nthe event it is determined by the commissioner that the wages or\nsupplements or both of any employees of such subcontractors have not\nbeen paid or provided pursuant to the appropriate schedule of wages and\nsupplements, the contractor shall be responsible for payment of such\nwages or supplements pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred\nthirty-nine-a of this article. Before final payment is made of any sums\ndue on account of such service work contract, the contractor shall be\nrequired to file a supplemental statement setting forth any additional\namounts known by the contractor to be then due and owing by each\nsubcontractor for such wages or supplements, or that the contractor has\nno knowledge of such amounts owing to or on behalf of any employee of\nits subcontractors.
