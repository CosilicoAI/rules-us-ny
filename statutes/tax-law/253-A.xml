            <p>For the purpose of determining whether a mortgage is subject to\nthe tax authorized to be imposed by paragraph (B) or (C) of subdivision\none of this section at a rate in excess of fifty cents, or by paragraph\n(D) of subdivision one of this section at a rate in excess of one\ndollar, for each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction\nthereof of principal debt or obligation, the principal debt or\nobligation which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date\nof execution thereof, or at any time thereafter, by such mortgage shall\nbe aggregated with the principal debt or obligation which is or under\nany contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof, or at\nany time thereafter, by any other mortgage, where such mortgages form\npart of the same or related transactions and have the same or related\nmortgagors. If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that a\nmortgage transaction or mortgage transactions have been formulated for\nthe purpose of avoiding or evading a rate of tax authorized to be\nimposed under subdivision one of this section in excess of the lowest\nsuch authorized rate, rather than solely for an independent business or\nfinancial purpose, such commissioner shall treat all of the mortgages\nforming part of such transaction or transactions as a single mortgage\nfor the purpose of determining the applicable rate of tax. For purposes\nof this subdivision, there shall be a presumption that all mortgages\noffered for recording within a period of twelve consecutive months\nhaving the same or related mortgagors are part of a related transaction,\nand such presumption may be rebutted only with clear and convincing\nevidence to the contrary. The commissioner of taxation and finance may\nrequire such affidavits and forms, and may prescribe such rules and\nregulations, as he determines to be necessary to enforce the provisions\nof this subdivision.\n</p>

            <p>of\nsubdivision one of section two hundred fifty-five of this chapter.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, all the provisions of this\narticle relating to or applicable to the administration and collection\nof the taxes imposed by such subdivisions shall apply to the taxes\nimposed under the authority of this section with such modifications as\nmay be necessary to adapt such language to the tax so authorized. Such\nprovisions shall apply with the same force and effect as if those\nprovisions had been set forth in full in this section except to the\nextent that any provision is either inconsistent with a provision of\nthis section or not relevant to the tax authorized by this section. For\npurposes of this section, any reference in this article to the tax or\ntaxes imposed by this article shall be deemed to refer to a tax imposed\npursuant to this section, and any reference to the phrase "within this\nstate" shall be read as "within a city imposing a tax pursuant to\nsection two hundred fifty-three-a", unless a different meaning is\nclearly required.\n  * NB Amended as sub 4;should be sub 3\n  4.
