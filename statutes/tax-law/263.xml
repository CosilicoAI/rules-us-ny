            <p>of this subdivision. Provided, however, no\nsuch interest shall be allowed or paid if the refund check is issued\nwithin ninety days of the date such application is received and no\ninterest shall be allowed or paid if the amount of interest would be\nless than one dollar. The amount so ordered to be paid shall be paid\nfrom mortgage tax moneys in such recording officer's hands, or which\nshall come to his hands, to the party entitled to receive it and the\nrecording officer shall charge such amount back to the state, public\nbenefit corporation or tax district, as the case may be, that may have\nbeen credited with the same. No refund of tax paid under this article\nshall be allowed unless the application for refund is filed within two\nyears from the time the erroneous payment of tax was received or, in the\ncase of a refund arising out of the exercise of the right of rescission,\nwithin two years from the time of payment of tax or one year from the\ndate of discharge of the mortgage which is subject to such exercise,\nwhichever is later. If any recording officer shall have collected and\npaid over to the treasurer of any county, or to the state or a public\nbenefit corporation, a tax paid upon a mortgage which under the\nprovisions of section two hundred sixty of this chapter is to be\napportioned by the commissioner of taxation and finance before such\napportionment has been made, or if any recording officer shall have paid\nover to a county treasurer, the state or a public benefit corporation\nmore money than required on account of mortgage taxes, such recording\nofficer shall make a report to the commissioner of taxation and finance\nin the form of a verified statement of facts and said commissioner shall\ndetermine the method of adjustment and, after audit thereof by the\ncomptroller, shall issue his order accordingly.\n</p>
