Provided further, the state tax\ncommission shall issue a determination with respect to such application\nwhere there has been a proposed transfer of registration within\nseventy-five days after the day of the receipt of a properly completed\napplication containing such information as the said tax commission may\nrequire. If the tax commission fails to issue a determination within\nsuch time, the tax commission shall be required to register such\nproposed transferee.\n</p>
