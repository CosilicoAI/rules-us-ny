For the purposes of this section, the term\n"hotel" or "motel" shall mean and include any facility providing lodging\non an overnight basis and shall include those facilities designated and\ncommonly known as "bed and breakfast" and "tourist" facilities.\n  The rates of such tax shall not exceed five percent of the per diem\nrental rate for each room, provided however, that such tax shall not be\napplicable to a permanent resident of a hotel or motel. For the purposes\nof this section the term "permanent resident" shall mean a person\noccupying any room or rooms in a hotel or motel for at least thirty\nconsecutive days.\n  (2) Such tax may be collected and administered by the deputy county\nadministrator of finance or other fiscal officers of Tompkins county by\nsuch means and in such manner as other taxes which are now collected and\nadministered by such officers or as otherwise may be provided by such\nlocal law.\n  (3) Such local laws may provide that any tax imposed shall be paid by\nthe person liable therefor to the owner of the hotel or motel room\noccupied or to the person entitled to be paid the rent or charge for the\nhotel or motel room occupied for and on account of the county of\nTompkins imposing the tax and that such owner or person entitled to be\npaid the rent or charge shall be liable for the collection and payment\nof the tax; and that such owner or person entitled to be paid the rent\nor charge shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax\nfrom the person occupying the hotel or motel room, or in respect to\nnonpayment of the tax by the person occupying the hotel or motel room,\nas if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the same\ntime as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the deputy county\nadministrator of finance or other fiscal officers of the county,\nspecified in such local law, shall be joined as a party in any action or\nproceeding brought to collect the tax by the owner or by the person\nentitled to be paid the rent or charge.\n  (4) Such local laws may provide for the filing of returns and the\npayment of the tax on a monthly basis or on the basis of any longer or\nshorter period of time.\n  (5) This section shall not authorize the imposition of such tax upon\nany transaction, by or with any of the following in accordance with\nsection twelve hundred thirty of this chapter:\n  a. The state of New York, or any public corporation (including a\npublic corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another\nstate or the dominion of Canada), improvement district or other\npolitical subdivision of the state;\n  b. The United States of America, insofar as it is immune from\ntaxation;\n  c. Any corporation or association, or trust, or community chest, fund\nor foundation organized and operated exclusively for religious,\ncharitable or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to\nchildren or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to\nthe benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no substantial\npart of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise\nattempting to influence legislation; provided, however, that the\nprovisions of this paragraph shall not apply to an organization operated\nfor the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit,\nwhether or not all of its profits are payable to one or more\norganizations described in this paragraph. Nothing in this subdivision\nshall prohibit any organization exempt from taxation pursuant to this\nparagraph from collecting the taxes imposed pursuant to this section\nfrom individuals who are doing business with such exempt organization\nand who are not exempt from taxation pursuant to this subdivision.\n  (6) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder\nshall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any\nother reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of\nthe civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the\nsupreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of such\nfinal determination, provided, however, that any such proceeding under\narticle seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be\ninstituted unless:\n  a. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and\npenalties thereon as may be provided for by local law or regulation\nshall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by a\nsurety company authorized to transact business in this state and\napproved by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to\nsolvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme\ncourt shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed\nor the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which\nmay accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or\n  b. At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be in a sum\nsufficient to cover the taxes, interests and penalties stated in such\ndetermination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in\nthe prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall\nnot be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition\nprecedent to the application.\n  (7) Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously,\nillegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund\nthereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers, and such\nofficer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,\nsuch determination shall be reviewable by a proceeding under article\nseventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided, however,\nthat such proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving\nof the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due was\nnot previously made, and that an undertaking is filed with the proper\nfiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such sureties as a\njustice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such\nproceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay\nall costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such\nproceeding.\n  (8) Except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with\nintent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made\nafter the expiration of more than three years from the date of the\nfiling of a return, provided, however, that where no return has been\nfiled as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.\n  (9) All revenues resulting from the imposition of the tax under the\nlocal laws shall be paid into the treasury of Tompkins county and shall\nbe credited to and deposited in the general fund of the county,\nthereafter to be allocated for tourist and convention development;\nprovided, however, that such local laws shall provide that the county\nshall be authorized to retain up to a maximum of ten percent of such\nrevenue to defer the necessary expenses of the county in administering\nsuch tax. The revenue derived from the tax, after deducting the amount\nprovided for administering such tax, as so authorized by local law,\nshall be allocated to enhance the general economy of Tompkins county,\nits cities, towns, and villages, through promotion of tourist\nactivities, conventions, trade shows, special events, and other directly\nrelated and supporting activities.\n  (10) If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any\nperson or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of this act\nand the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances\nshall not be affected thereby.\n</p>
