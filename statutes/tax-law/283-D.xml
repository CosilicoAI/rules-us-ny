No wholesaler of motor fuel shall make a\nsale of motor fuel in this state other than a retail sale not in bulk\nunless such wholesaler is so registered.

All of the provisions\nof subdivisions two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten of\nsection two hundred eighty-three of this article relating to\nregistration of distributors shall be applicable to the registration of\nwholesalers of motor fuel under this section with the same force and\neffect as if the language of such subdivisions had been incorporated in\nfull in this section and had expressly referred to the registration of\nwholesalers of motor fuel, with such modification as may be necessary in\norder to adapt the language of such provisions to the provisions of this\nsection, provided, specifically, that the term "distributor" shall be\nread as "wholesaler of motor fuel." Provided, however, that if the\ncommissioner is satisfied that the requirements of such provisions for\nregistration are not necessary in order to protect tax revenues, the\ncommissioner may limit or modify such requirements with respect to any\nperson not required to be registered as a distributor of motor fuel.\n</p>

If securities are deposited as security under this\nsubdivision, such securities shall be kept in the joint custody of the\ncomptroller and the commissioner and may be sold by the commissioner if\nit becomes necessary so to do in order to recover against such\nwholesaler of motor fuel but no such sale shall be had until after such\nwholesaler of motor fuel shall have had opportunity to litigate the\nvalidity of the liability if it elects to do so. Upon any such sale the\nsurplus, if any, above the sums due shall be returned to such wholesaler\nof motor fuel. The department, when authorized by the wholesaler of\nmotor fuel, shall furnish information regarding the registration of the\nwholesaler of motor fuel and any other information which the wholesaler\nof motor fuel authorizes it to disclose.\n</p>
