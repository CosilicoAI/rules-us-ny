An application for a\ncertificate of registration must be submitted electronically, on a form\nprescribed by the commissioner, and must be accompanied by a\nnon-refundable application fee of six hundred dollars. A certificate of\nregistration shall not be assignable or transferable and shall be\ndestroyed immediately upon such person ceasing to do business as\nspecified in such certificate, or in the event that such business never\ncommenced.\n</p>

Such refund or credit shall be deemed a refund of tax\npaid in error, provided, however, no interest shall be allowed or paid\non any such refund.\n</p>
