            <p>\nof this paragraph, the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of\nthis article shall apply to the recording of a spreading agreement or\nadditional mortgage which imposes the lien thereof upon real property\nlocated in any city in the state having a population of one million or\nmore and not originally covered by or described in a recorded primary\nmortgage, unless the real property that becomes subject to the lien of\nsuch spreading agreement or additional mortgage is owned by the\nmortgagor of the real property subject to the lien of such recorded\nprimary mortgage. If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that\ntransfers of one or both of such properties in connection with the\nrecording of the spreading agreement or additional mortgage have been\nundertaken for the purpose of avoiding or evading the application of\nthis paragraph rather than solely for an independent business or\nfinancial purpose, such commissioner may disregard such transfers. For\npurposes of this subparagraph, there shall be a presumption that all\ntransfers of one or both of such properties to related parties within\nthe twelve-month period preceding the recording of such spreading\nagreement or additional mortgage have been undertaken for tax avoidance\nor evasion purposes and such presumption may be rebutted only with clear\nand convincing evidence to the contrary. For this purpose, the term\n"related" shall have the same meaning as in paragraph</p>
