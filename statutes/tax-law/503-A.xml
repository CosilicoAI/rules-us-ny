            <p>\nof section eleven hundred eleven of this chapter and the schedules\nprescribed by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to such\nsubdivision, and shall be based on the average price per gallon\n(including all federal and state and any local taxes included in such\nprice or imposed on the use or consumption of such fuels but determined\nwithout the inclusion of any state and local sales tax on receipts from\nsales of such fuels) paid by the carrier during the return period for\nall motor fuel and diesel motor fuel purchased for use in its operations\neither within or without this state. Provided, however, if the\ncommissioner shall determine that the records of any carrier are\ninadequate or incomplete for such a determination of average price, the\nprice for motor fuel and diesel motor fuel purchased by such carrier\nshall be deemed to be the prevailing price for motor fuel and diesel\nmotor fuel, as established by the commissioner each calendar quarter\npursuant to this section, applicable to the return period. Each calendar\nquarter, the commissioner shall for each calendar quarter establish a\nprevailing price for motor fuel and diesel motor fuel based on the\nprices being charged on any given day during the first fifteen days of\nthe previous calendar quarter at a minimum of ten selected truck stops\nwidely scattered throughout the state. For any return period, a carrier\nmay elect to use the prevailing price per gallon so established by the\ncommissioner. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying such composite\nrate by the amount of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, as the case may\nbe, used by a carrier in its operations within this state during each\ncalendar quarter or, where the commissioner has required or permitted a\nreturn to be based upon a different period, during such other period.\nThe amount of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in the operations of\nany carrier within this state shall be such proportion of the total\namount of suc...</p>

            <p>a fuel tax component computed by multiplying\nthe number of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel purchased by\nsuch carrier within this state in a return period, for use in its\noperations either within or without this state, by the applicable rate\nper gallon imposed on such fuel under article twelve-A of this chapter,\nprovided, however, no credit shall be allowed unless the tax imposed\nunder such article twelve-A upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by\nsuch carrier, and (ii) a sales tax component computed by multiplying the\nnumber of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel purchased by such\ncarrier within this state in a return period, for use in its operations\neither within or without this state (as determined in a manner similar\nto the method for determining the use of fuel in the state as provided\nfor under subdivision two of this section), by the applicable equivalent\nrate per gallon of the sales tax component of the tax rate (as\ndetermined under subdivision two of this section), provided, however, no\ncredit shall be allowed unless the tax imposed under article\ntwenty-eight of this chapter upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by\nthe carrier. Each carrier claiming such credit components shall furnish\nto the commissioner such evidence of payment of such taxes as the\ncommissioner may require. When the amount of the credit to which any\ncarrier is entitled for any return period with respect to gallonage\npurchased in such return period exceeds the amount of tax for which such\ncarrier is liable under this section for such return period, such excess\nshall be allowed as a credit against the tax or which such carrier would\notherwise be liable for those succeeding periods (after application of\nany credits derived with respect to gallonage purchased in each such\nsucceeding period) which fall wholly within the twenty-four month period\ncommencing with the end of the return period from which the excess was\nderived or, if a claim for r...</p>
