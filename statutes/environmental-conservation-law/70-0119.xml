If a public hearing is to be held, it shall commence on or before\nninety calendar days after the department mails written notice to the\napplicant that the application is complete or on or before ninety\ncalendar days after the application is deemed complete pursuant to the\nprovisions of this article. Reasonable notice of the hearing shall be\ngiven to the applicant and to persons who have made written request to\nparticipate in it and notice to the public shall be given by publication\nof a notice of hearing in the environmental notice bulletin, in a\nnewspaper as otherwise required by law, and in such other manner as the\ndepartment may direct, if any.\n  3. The department may require an applicant to pay the cost of renting\na hearing room and of preparing a transcript associated with a public\nhearing conducted pursuant to this article. Prior to commencing a public\nhearing pursuant to this article, the department may require an\napplicant to post a bond or other suitable undertaking to assure payment\nof such costs.\n  4. When an applicant has submitted applications for one or more\npermits associated with a project and more than one public hearing is\nrequired, including public hearings pursuant to article eight of this\nchapter, said public hearings shall be consolidated into a single public\nhearing at the request of the applicant wherever practicable.  Public\nhearings associated with a project shall also be consolidated or held\njointly with one or more other state or local agencies, whenever\npracticable.\n  5.
