If any such claim is asserted by or on\nbehalf of any person in the course of any such prosecution, the court in\nwhich the proceedings are had may make such order, or may stay the\njudgment for such time as he deems proper to permit determination of the\nclaim or application for a stay of the operation of this subdivision.\n  3.

Establishment of a claim of\nownership shall not in any event entitle the person establishing it to\ndelivery of the property if the state shall establish that the illegal\nuse or possession of such property, in the manner or for the purposes or\nin the circumstances making such use or possession illegal, was\nexpressly or impliedly permitted by the person establishing such claim\nof ownership.\n  d.
