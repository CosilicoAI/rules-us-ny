In connection with each contract, the commissioner shall keep\nadequate records of the amount of the payment by the state, if any,\nreceived by the municipality. Such records shall be retained by the\ncommissioner and shall establish the basis for recalculation of the\nstate payment as required herein.\n  3. The commissioner shall impose such contractual requirements and\nconditions upon any municipality which receives state assistance\npayments pursuant to this title as may be necessary and appropriate to\nensure that a public benefit shall accrue from the use of public funds\nby such municipality. Such conditions shall include limitations on the\nright of the municipality to demolish or convey such property,\nprovisions for public access or use where appropriate, a requirement\nthat all plans for restoration, rehabilitation, improvement, demolition\nor other physical change must be subject to the commissioner's approval,\nand such other conditions which shall assure the preservation and\nprotection of the project.\n</p>
