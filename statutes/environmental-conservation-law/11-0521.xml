Upon presentation of such proof,\nthe department may issue a permit authorizing the use of trained\ntracking dogs pursuant to section 11-0928 of this article, and, if the\ndepartment has determined that no other alternative is feasible, a\nseparate permit to take the bear. Wildlife so taken shall be disposed of\nas the department may direct.
