The price to be paid for the amount of\nwater so to be taken may be agreed upon between the applicant and the\ntaker of the water, or if they cannot agree, fair and reasonable amounts\nand rates shall be, after due hearings thereon, fixed by the public\nservice commission. Any such agreement or determination of the public\nservice commission may from time to time be modified by further\nagreement between the parties affected thereby or by the further order\nof the commission.\n</p>
