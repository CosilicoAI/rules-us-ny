Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Compact.\n  The Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Compact, as first enacted by\nchapter 776 of the laws of 1939, and as reenacted by chapter 472 of the\nlaws of 1961, is hereby continued. The compact is as follows:\n               OHIO RIVER VALLEY WATER SANITATION COMPACT\n  Whereas a substantial part of the territory of each of the signatory\nstates is situated within the drainage basin of the Ohio river; and\n  Whereas the rapid increase in the population of the various\nmetropolitan areas situated within the Ohio drainage basin, and the\ngrowth in industrial activity within that area, have resulted in recent\nyears in an increasingly serious pollution of the waters and streams\nwithin the said drainage basin, constituting a grave menace to the\nhealth, welfare, and recreational facilities of the people living in\nsuch basin, and occasioning great economic loss; and\n  Whereas the control of future pollution and the abatement of existing\npollution in the waters of said basin are of prime importance to the\npeople thereof, and can best be accomplished through the cooperation of\nthe states situated therein, by and through a joint or common agency;\n  Now, therefore, the states of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, New York,\nOhio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia do hereby covenant and\nagree as follows:\n                                ARTICLE I\n  Each of the signatory states pledges to each of the other signatory\nstates faithful cooperation in the control of future pollution in and\nabatement of existing pollution from the rivers, streams and waters in\nthe Ohio river basin which flow through, into, or border upon any of\nsuch signatory states, and in order to effect such object, agrees to\nenact any necessary legislation to enable each such state to place and\nmaintain the waters of said basin in a satisfactory sanitary condition,\navailable for safe and satisfactory use as public and industrial water\nsupplies after reasonable treatment, suitable for recreational usage,\ncapable of maintaining fish and other aquatic life, free from unsightly\nor malodorous nuisances due to floating solids or sludge deposits, and\nadaptable to such other uses as may be legitimate.\n                               ARTICLE II\n  The signatory states hereby create a district to be known as the "Ohio\nriver valley water sanitation district," hereinafter called the\ndistrict, which shall embrace all territory within the signatory states\nthe water in which flows ultimately into the Ohio river, or its\ntributaries.\n                               ARTICLE III\n  The signatory states hereby create the "Ohio river valley water\nsanitation commission," hereinafter called the commission, which shall\nbe a body corporate, with the powers and duties set forth herein, and\nsuch additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action\nof the respective legislatures of the signatory states or by act or acts\nof the congress of the United States.\n                               ARTICLE IV\n  The commission shall consist of three commissioners from each state,\neach of whom shall be a citizen of the state from which he is appointed,\nand three commissioners representing the United States government. The\ncommissioners from each state shall be chosen in the manner and for the\nterms provided by the laws of the state from which they shall be\nappointed, and any commissioner may be removed or suspended from office\nas provided by the law of the state from which he shall be appointed.\nThe commissioners representing the United States shall be appointed by\nthe president of the United States, or in such other manner as may be\nprovided by congress.
