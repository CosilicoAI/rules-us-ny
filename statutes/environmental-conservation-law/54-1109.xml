In connection with each contract, the commissioner shall keep\nadequate records of the amount of the payment by the state and of the\namount of federal assistance, if any, received by the municipality or\nnot-for-profit corporation. Such records shall be retained by the\ncommissioner and shall establish the basis for recalculation of the\nstate payment as required herein.\n</p>
