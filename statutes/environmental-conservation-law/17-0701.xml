Increase or alter the content of the wastes discharged through an\noutlet or point source into the waters of the state by a change in\nvolume or physical, chemical or biological characteristics.\n  2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, for the\npurposes of this title, the following definitions shall be applicable:\n  a.

No person, corporation, public authority, or public benefit\ncorporation shall construct or operate any new steam-electric generating\nfacility or increase the capacity of any existing steam-electric\ngenerating facility without a permit issued in accordance with the\nprovisions of this subdivision allowing thermal discharge from such\nfacility to the waters of the state.
