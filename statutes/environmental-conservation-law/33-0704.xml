For registration applications subject to review pursuant to\nsubdivisions two through five of this section, an application for\npesticide registration shall be determined by the commissioner to be\ncomplete or incomplete within sixty days of receipt of an application\nfor registration. If the commissioner does not issue a determination of\ncompleteness or incompleteness within sixty days of receipt of an\napplication for registration, the application shall be deemed complete.\nUpon reaching a determination of completeness or incompleteness, the\ncommissioner shall send written notice to the applicant. If the\napplication is determined to be incomplete, the commissioner shall\ninclude a statement of the reasons for which the application was\ndetermined to be incomplete. The resubmission of the application or the\nsubmission of additional information in response to a request for\nadditional information shall commence a new sixty calendar day period\nfor department review of the additional information for purposes of\ndetermining completeness.\n  2. The commissioner shall issue or deny registration of a pesticide\nwhich contains an active ingredient not previously registered by the\ncommissioner or which contains an active ingredient previously\nregistered for which a major change in labeling is proposed within one\nhundred fifty days of a determination that such application is complete.\nIf registration of such pesticide is not granted or denied within such\nperiod, the applicant may submit to the commissioner, in the form\nprescribed by the commissioner, a request to grant or deny the\nregistration. If the registration is not granted or denied within thirty\ndays following the receipt of such a request, the registration shall be\ndeemed granted. Any denial of registration shall specify the grounds for\ndenial.\n  3. The commissioner shall issue or deny registration of a pesticide to\nmeet a special local need within sixty days of a determination that such\napplication is complete. If registration of such pesticide is not\ngranted or denied within such period, the applicant may submit to the\ncommissioner, in the form prescribed by the commissioner, a request to\ngrant or deny the registration. If the registration is not granted or\ndenied within ten business days following receipt of such a request, the\nregistration shall be deemed granted. Any denial of registration shall\nspecify the grounds for denial.\n  4.

Any time period specified in this section may be extended with the\nconsent of the applicant.\n  9.
