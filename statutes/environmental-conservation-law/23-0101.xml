"Oil" means crude petroleum oil and all other hydrocarbons,\nregardless of gravity, that are produced at the wellhead in liquid form\nby ordinary production methods and that are not the result of\ncondensation of gas.\n  11. "Owner" means the person who has the right to drill into and\nproduce from a pool or a salt deposit and to appropriate the oil, gas or\nsalt he produces either for himself or others, or for himself and\nothers.\n  12.

"Pool" means an underground reservoir containing a common\naccumulation of oil or gas or both; each zone of a structure which is\ncompletely separated from any other zone in the same structure is a\npool.\n  15. "Producer" means the owner of a well or wells capable of producing\noil, gas, or salt; or any salt or hydrocarbon mixture.\n  16.

"Waste" means\n  a. Physical waste, as that term is generally understood in the oil and\ngas industry;\n  b. The inefficient, excessive or improper use of, or the unnecessary\ndissipation of reservoir energy;\n  c. The locating, spacing, drilling, equipping, operating, or producing\nof any oil or gas well or wells in a manner which causes or tends to\ncause reduction in the quantity of oil or gas ultimately recoverable\nfrom a pool under prudent and proper operations, or which causes or\ntends to cause unnecessary or excessive surface loss or destruction of\noil or gas;\n  d. The inefficient storing of oil or gas; and\n  e. The flaring of gas produced from an oil or condensate well after\nthe department has found that the use of the gas, on terms that are just\nand reasonable, is, or will be economically feasible within a reasonable\ntime.\n</p>
