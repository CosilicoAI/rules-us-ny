            <p>Forfeiture may be ordered when the grand jury returning an\nindictment charging a person with enterprise corruption has received\nevidence legally sufficient to establish, and providing reasonable cause\nto believe, that the property or other interest is subject to forfeiture\nunder this section. In that event, the grand jury shall file a special\ninformation, not to be disclosed to the jury in the criminal action\nprior to verdict on the criminal charges, specifying the property or\nother interest for which forfeiture is sought and containing a plain and\nconcise factual statement which sets forth the basis for the forfeiture.\nAlternatively, where the defendant has waived indictment and consented\nto be prosecuted by superior court information pursuant to article one\nhundred ninety-five of the criminal procedure law, the prosecutor may\nfile, in addition to the superior court information charging enterprise\ncorruption, a special information specifying the property or other\ninterest for which forfeiture is sought and containing a plain and\nconcise factual statement which sets forth the basis for the forfeiture.\n</p>

In addition, any person claiming an interest in property\nsubject to forfeiture may petition for remission as provided in\nsubdivision seven of section thirteen hundred eleven of such law and\nrules.\n  4. All property and other interests which are criminally forfeited\nfollowing the commencement of an action under this article, whether by\nplea, verdict or other agreement, shall be disposed of in accordance\nwith the provisions of section thirteen hundred forty-nine of the civil\npractice law and rules. In any case where one or more of the counts upon\nwhich a person is convicted specifically includes as a criminal act a\nviolation of any offense defined in article two hundred twenty of this\nchapter, the court shall determine what portion of that property or\ninterest derives from or relates to such criminal act, and direct that\ndistribution of that portion be conducted in the manner prescribed for\nactions grounded upon offenses in violation of article two hundred\ntwenty.\n  5. Any person convicted of a violation of section 460.20 of this\narticle through which he derived pecuniary value, or by which he caused\npersonal injury or property damage or other loss, may be sentenced to\npay a fine not in excess of three times the gross value he gained or\nthree times the gross loss he caused, whichever is greater.
