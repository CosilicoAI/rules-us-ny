"Written instrument" means any instrument or article, including\ncomputer data or a computer program, containing written or printed\nmatter or the equivalent thereof, used for the purpose of reciting,\nembodying, conveying or recording information, or constituting a symbol\nor evidence of value, right, privilege or identification, which is\ncapable of being used to the advantage or disadvantage of some person.\nFor the purposes of this article, a card provided to a person by a\nvaccine provider indicating the date a person received a vaccination\nagainst COVID-19, the type of vaccine and its lot number, and bearing a\ngovernment logo or other indication that it is created by a governmental\ninstrumentality, shall be considered a written instrument.\n  2. "Complete written instrument" means one which purports to be a\ngenuine written instrument fully drawn with respect to every essential\nfeature thereof. An endorsement, attestation, acknowledgment or other\nsimilar signature or statement is deemed both a complete written\ninstrument in itself and a part of the main instrument in which it is\ncontained or to which it attaches.\n  3. "Incomplete written instrument" means one which contains some\nmatter by way of content or authentication but which requires additional\nmatter in order to render it a complete written instrument.\n  4. "Falsely make." A person "falsely makes" a written instrument when\nhe makes or draws a complete written instrument in its entirety, or an\nincomplete written instrument, which purports to be an authentic\ncreation of its ostensible maker or drawer, but which is not such either\nbecause the ostensible maker or drawer is fictitious or because, if\nreal, he did not authorize the making or drawing thereof.\n  5. "Falsely complete." A person "falsely completes" a written\ninstrument when, by adding, inserting or changing matter, he transforms\nan incomplete written instrument into a complete one, without the\nauthority of anyone entitled to grant it, so that such complete\ninstrument appears or purports to be in all respects an authentic\ncreation of or fully authorized by its ostensible maker or drawer.\n  6. "Falsely alter." A person "falsely alters" a written instrument\nwhen, without the authority of anyone entitled to grant it, he changes a\nwritten instrument, whether it be in complete or incomplete form, by\nmeans of erasure, obliteration, deletion, insertion of new matter,\ntransposition of matter, or in any other manner, so that such instrument\nin its thus altered form appears or purports to be in all respects an\nauthentic creation of or fully authorized by its ostensible maker or\ndrawer.\n  7. "Forged instrument" means a written instrument which has been\nfalsely made, completed or altered.\n  8. "Electronic access device" means a mobile identification number or\nelectronic serial number that can be used to obtain telephone service.\n</p>
