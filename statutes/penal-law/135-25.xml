The person abducted dies during the abduction or before he is able\nto return or to be returned to safety. Such death shall be presumed, in\na case where such person was less than sixteen years old or an\nincompetent person at the time of the abduction, from evidence that his\nparents, guardians or other lawful custodians did not see or hear from\nhim following the termination of the abduction and prior to trial and\nreceived no reliable information during such period persuasively\nindicating that he was alive. In all other cases, such death shall be\npresumed from evidence that a person whom the person abducted would have\nbeen extremely likely to visit or communicate with during the specified\nperiod were he alive and free to do so did not see or hear from him\nduring such period and received no reliable information during such\nperiod persuasively indicating that he was alive.\n  Kidnapping in the first degree is a class A-I felony.\n</p>
