            <p>Actions relating to post-conviction forfeiture crimes. An action\nrelating to a post-conviction forfeiture crime must be grounded upon a\nconviction of a felony defined in subdivision five of section one\nthousand three hundred ten of this article or upon a count of an\nindictment or information alleging a felony which was dismissed at the\ntime of a plea of guilty to a felony in satisfaction of such count. A\ncourt may not grant forfeiture until such conviction has occurred.\nHowever, an action may be commenced, and a court may grant a provisional\nremedy provided under this article, prior to such conviction having\noccurred. An action under this paragraph must be dismissed at any time\nafter sixty days of the commencement of the action unless the conviction\nupon which the action is grounded has occurred, or an indictment or\ninformation upon which the asserted conviction is to be based is pending\nin a superior court. An action under this paragraph shall be stayed\nduring the pendency of a criminal action which is related to it;\nprovided, however, that such stay shall not prevent the granting or\ncontinuance of any provisional remedy provided under this article or any\nother provisions of law.\n</p>
