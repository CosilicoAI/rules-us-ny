            <p>Without consent to court of limited jurisdiction. The appellate\ndivision, if it determines that the calendar conditions in a lower court\nso permit, may by rule provide that a court in which an action is\npending may, in its discretion, remove such action without consent to\nsuch lower court where it appears that the amount of damages sustained\nmay be less than demanded, and the lower court would have had\njurisdiction but for the amount of damages demanded. If the action is so\nremoved, then the verdict or judgment shall be subject to the limitation\nof monetary jurisdiction of the court in which the action was originally\ncommenced and shall be lawful to the extent of the amount demanded\nwithin such limitation. A waiver of jury trial in the first court is\ninoperative after the removal.\n</p>
