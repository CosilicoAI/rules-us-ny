No action for the recovery of any sum of money due and\npayable under or on account of a contract, or for any part thereof,\nshall be commenced by any person who has made claim to the sum, after\nthe expiration of one year from the giving of notice, as hereinafter\nprovided, to the claimant that an action commenced by another person is\npending to recover the sum, or any part thereof, exceeding fifty dollars\nin amount.
