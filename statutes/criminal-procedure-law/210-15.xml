            <p>To have counsel assigned by the court in any case where he is\nfinancially unable to obtain the same.\n  3. The court must inform the defendant of all rights specified in\nsubdivision two. The court must accord the defendant opportunity to\nexercise such rights and must itself take such affirmative action as is\nnecessary to effectuate them.\n  5. If the defendant desires to proceed without the aid of counsel, the\ncourt must permit him to do so if it is satisfied that he made such\ndecision with knowledge of the significance thereof, but if it is not so\nsatisfied it may not proceed until the defendant is provided with\ncounsel, either of his own choosing or by assignment. A defendant who\nproceeds at the arraignment without counsel does not waive his right to\ncounsel, and the court must inform him that he continues to have such\nright as well as all the rights specified in subdivision two which are\nnecessary to effectuate it, and that he may exercise such rights at any\nstage of the action.\n  6. Upon the arraignment, the court, unless it intends to make a final\ndisposition of the action immediately thereafter, must, as provided in\nsection 530.40, issue a securing order, releasing the defendant on his\nown recognizance or fixing bail or committing him to the custody of the\nsheriff for his future appearance in such action.\n</p>
