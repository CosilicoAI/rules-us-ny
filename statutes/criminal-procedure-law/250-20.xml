For good cause shown, the court may extend the period for service\nof the notice.\n  2.  Within a reasonable time after receipt of the defendant's witness\nlist but not later than ten days before trial, the people must serve\nupon the defendant or his counsel, and file a copy thereof with the\ncourt, a list of the witnesses the people propose to offer in rebuttal\nto discredit the defendant's alibi at the trial together with the\nresidential addresses, the places of employment and the addresses\nthereof of any such rebuttal witnesses.  A witness who will testify\nthat the defendant was at the scene of the crime is not such an alibi\nrebuttal witness.  For good cause shown, the court may extend the period\nfor service of the list of witnesses by the people.\n  3.  If at the trial the defendant calls such an alibi witness without\nhaving served the demanded notice of alibi, or if having served such a\nnotice he calls a witness not specified therein, the court may exclude\nany testimony of such witness relating to the alibi defense.  The court\nmay in its discretion receive such testimony, but before doing so, it\nmust, upon application of the people, grant an adjournment not in excess\nof three days.\n  4.  Similarly, if the people fail to serve and file a list of any\nrebuttal witnesses, the provisions of subdivision three, above, shall\nreciprocally apply.\n  5.  Both the defendant and the people shall be under a continuing duty\nto promptly disclose the names and addresses of additional witnesses\nwhich come to the attention of either party subsequent to filing their\nwitness lists as provided in this section.\n</p>
