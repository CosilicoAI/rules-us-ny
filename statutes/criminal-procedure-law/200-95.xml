            <p>"Request for a bill of particulars" is a written request served by\ndefendant upon the people, without leave of the court, requesting a bill\nof particulars, specifying the items of factual information desired, and\nalleging that defendant cannot adequately prepare or conduct his defense\nwithout the information requested.\n  2. Bill of particulars upon request. Upon a timely request for a bill\nof particulars by a defendant against whom an indictment is pending, the\nprosecutor shall within fifteen days of the service of the request or as\nsoon thereafter as is practicable, serve upon the defendant or his\nattorney, and file with the court, the bill of particulars, except to\nthe extent the prosecutor shall have refused to comply with the request\npursuant to subdivision four of this section.\n  3. Timeliness of request. A request for a bill of particulars shall be\ntimely if made within thirty days after arraignment and before the\ncommencement of trial.

The prosecutor may refuse to comply with the\nrequest for a bill of particulars or any portion of the request for a\nbill of particulars to the extent he reasonably believes that the item\nof factual information requested is not authorized to be included in a\nbill of particulars, or that such information is not necessary to enable\nthe defendant adequately to prepare or conduct his defense, or that a\nprotective order would be warranted or that the demand is untimely.

            <p>The court in which the criminal action is\npending may, upon motion of the prosecutor, or of any affected person,\nor upon determination of a motion of defendant for a court ordered bill\nof particulars, or upon its own initiative, issue a protective order\ndenying, limiting, conditioning, delaying or regulating the bill of\nparticulars for good cause, including constitutional limitations, danger\nto the integrity of physical evidence or a substantial risk of physical\nharm, intimidation, economic reprisal, bribery or unjustified annoyance\nor embarrassment to any person or an adverse effect upon the legitimate\nneeds of law enforcement, including the protection of the\nconfidentiality of informants, or any other factor or set of factors\nwhich outweighs the need for the bill of particulars.\n</p>

            <p>An order limiting, conditioning, delaying or regulating the bill\nof particulars may, among other things, require that any material copied\nor derived therefrom be maintained in the exclusive possession of the\nattorney for the defendant and be used for the exclusive purpose of\npreparing for the defense of the criminal action.\n  8. Amendment. At any time before commencement of trial, the prosecutor\nmay, without leave of the court, serve upon defendant and file with the\ncourt an amended bill of particulars. At any time during trial, upon\napplication of the prosecutor and with notice to the defendant and an\nopportunity for him to be heard, the court must, upon finding that no\nundue prejudice will accrue to defendant and that the prosecutor has\nacted in good faith, permit the prosecutor to amend the bill of\nparticulars. Upon any amendment of the bill of particulars, the court\nmust, upon application of defendant, order an adjournment of the\nproceedings or any other action it deems appropriate which may, by\nreason of the amendment, be necessary to accord the defendant an\nadequate opportunity to defend.\n</p>
