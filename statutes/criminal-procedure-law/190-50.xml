            <p>When a criminal charge against a person is being or is about to\nbe or has been submitted to a grand jury, such person has a right to\nappear before such grand jury as a witness in his own behalf if, prior\nto the filing of any indictment or any direction to file a prosecutor's\ninformation in the matter, he serves upon the district attorney of the\ncounty a written notice making such request and stating an address to\nwhich communications may be sent.  The district attorney is not obliged\nto inform such a person that such a grand jury proceeding against him is\npending, in progress or about to occur unless such person is a defendant\nwho has been arraigned in a local criminal court upon a currently\nundisposed of felony complaint charging an offense which is a subject of\nthe prospective or pending grand jury proceeding.  In such case, the\ndistrict attorney must notify the defendant or his attorney of the\nprospective or pending grand jury proceeding and accord the defendant a\nreasonable time to exercise his right to appear as a witness therein;\n</p>
