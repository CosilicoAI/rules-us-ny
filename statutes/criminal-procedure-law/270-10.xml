          <p>§ 270.10  Trial jury; challenge to the panel.\n  1.  A challenge to the panel is an objection made to the entire panel\nof prospective trial jurors returned for the term and may be taken to\nsuch panel or to any additional panel that may be ordered by the court.\nSuch a challenge may be made only by the defendant and only on the\nground that there has been such a departure from the requirements of the\njudiciary law in the drawing or return of the panel as to result in\nsubstantial prejudice to the defendant.\n  2.  A challenge to the panel must be made before the selection of the\njury commences, and, if it is not, such challenge is deemed to have been\nwaived.  Such challenge must be made in writing setting forth the facts\nconstituting the ground of challenge.  If such facts are denied by the\npeople, witnesses may be called and examined by either party.  All\nissues of fact and law arising on the challenge must be tried and\ndetermined by the court.  If a challenge to the panel is allowed, the\ncourt must discharge that panel and order another panel of prospective\ntrial jurors returned for the term.\n</p>
