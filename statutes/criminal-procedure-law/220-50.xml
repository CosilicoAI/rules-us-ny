Within thirty days of the acceptance of the plea or superior court\ninformation by the court, the prosecutor shall send to the commissioner\nof the division of criminal justice services a document containing the\nname of the defendant, the description and present estimated monetary\nvalue of the property, any other demographic data as required by the\ndivision of criminal justice services and the date the plea or superior\ncourt information was accepted.

The failure to advise the defendant pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall not be deemed to affect the voluntariness of a plea of\nguilty or the validity of a conviction, nor shall it afford a defendant\nany rights in a subsequent proceeding relating to such defendant's\ndeportation, exclusion or denial of naturalization.\n  * NB Repealed September 1, 2027\n  8.
