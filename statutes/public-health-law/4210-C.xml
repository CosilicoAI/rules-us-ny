The proceeding shall have preference over\nall other cases in the court and shall be determined summarily upon the\npetition and such oral or written proof as may be offered by the\nparties. The court shall grant the relief sought in the petition if it\nfinds that the petitioner had established a demonstrable need for such\nautopsy or dissection under all circumstances of the case. If the\npetition is denied, and no stay is granted by the court or the appellate\ndivision, the body shall immediately be released for burial to the\nsurviving relative or friend.\n</p>
