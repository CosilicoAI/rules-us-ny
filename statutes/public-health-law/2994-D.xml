An operator, administrator,\nor employee of a hospital or a mental hygiene facility from which the\npatient was transferred, or a physician, nurse practitioner or physician\nassistant who has privileges at the hospital or a health care provider\nunder contract with the hospital may not serve as the surrogate for any\nadult who is a patient of such hospital, unless such individual is\nrelated to the patient by blood, marriage, domestic partnership, or\nadoption, or is a close friend of the patient whose friendship with the\npatient preceded the patient's admission to the facility. If a\nphysician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant serves as\nsurrogate, the physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant\nshall not act as the patient's attending practitioner after his or her\nauthority as surrogate begins.\n  3.
