If the agent is unable or unwilling to\narrange such a transfer, the hospital may intervene to facilitate such a\ntransfer. If such a transfer is not effected, the hospital shall seek\njudicial relief in accordance with section twenty-nine hundred\nninety-two of this article or honor the agent's decision.\n  4. Notwithstanding subdivision two of this section, nothing in this\narticle shall be construed to require an individual as a health care\nprovider to honor an agent's health care decision that the individual\nwould not honor if the decision had been made by the principal because\nthe decision is contrary to the individual's religious beliefs or\nsincerely held moral convictions, provided the individual health care\nprovider promptly informs the health care agent and the hospital of his\nor her refusal to honor the agent's decision. In such event, the\nhospital shall promptly transfer responsibility for the patient to\nanother individual health care provider willing to honor the agent's\ndecision.
