However, the reasonable charge for paper copies shall not\nexceed seventy-five cents per page. A release of records under this\nsection shall not be denied solely because of inability to pay. No\ncharge may be imposed under this section for providing, releasing, or\ndelivering medical records or copies of medical records where requested\nfor the purpose of supporting an application, claim or appeal for any\ngovernment benefit or program, provided that, where a provider maintains\nmedical records in electronic form, it shall provide the copy in either\nelectronic or paper form, as required by the government benefit or\nprogram, or at the patient's request.\n  For the purposes of this section the term "laboratory tests" shall\ninclude but not be limited to tests and examinations administered in\nclinical laboratories or blood banks as those terms are defined in\nsection five hundred seventy-one of this chapter.\n</p>
