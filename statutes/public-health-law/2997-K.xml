Such process shall require\nthat the nurse or direct care worker make a good faith effort to ensure\npatient safety and bring the matter to the attention of the facility in\na timely manner. A health care facility employee who reasonably and in\ngood faith follows the process developed by the health care facility in\naccordance with this subdivision shall not be the subject of\ndisciplinary action by the health care facility for the refusal to\nperform or be involved in the patient handling or movement.\n</p>
