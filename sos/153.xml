In the event that sufficient savings are not\nachieved by such reduction in reimbursement to the highest ranked\ndistrict, then the commissioner shall continue to reduce the amount of\nreimbursement for the highest and, as necessary, the sequentially ranked\ndistrict or districts such that such reductions, when applied in the\nfederal fiscal year, will equalize the proportion of federal\nreimbursement for administration received by all such affected districts\nand will equal an amount which, in aggregate, will be sufficient to\nfully offset but not exceed the federal reimbursement shortfall.\nNotwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, reimbursement to a\nsocial services district out of state and federal funds shall not be\nmade on administrative expenses which exceed fifteen percent of such\ndistrict's total expenditures reimbursable under the tem...</p>
