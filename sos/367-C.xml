            <p>Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section,\nthe commissioner is authorized and directed to establish a demonstration\nprogram for the purpose of determining the impact of raising the\nlimitation on expenditures for the delivery of long term home health\ncare services to persons with special needs as defined in this\nsubdivision. Pursuant to such program, the commissioner shall permit\nlocal social services officials to authorize, at their discretion, and\nonly after a determination that the maximum expenditure available\npursuant to subdivisions two and three of this section is not sufficient\nto provide or continue to provide long term home health care services to\npersons with special needs, maximum monthly expenditures for services\nunder this title to such persons, not to exceed one hundred percent of\nthe average of the monthly rates payable under this title for services\nin a nursing home or intermediate care facility within the social\nservices district for which the social services official has authority.\nHowever, if a continuing assessment of a person with special needs\ndemonstrates that he requires increased services, the social services\nofficial may authorize the expenditure of any amount accrued under this\nsection during the past twelve months as a result of the expenditures\nfor that person not having exceeded such maximum. If an assessment of a\nperson with special needs demonstrates that he requires increased\nservices the payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it\ncan be reasonably anticipated that total expenditures for required\nservices for such person will not exceed such maximum calculated over a\none year period, the social services official may authorize payment for\nsuch services.\n</p>
