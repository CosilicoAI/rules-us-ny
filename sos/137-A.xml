A\nsocial services official sending such notification to an employer shall\nbe required to notify the employer, in writing, of the termination of\nsuch receipt and need for public assistance and care of the employee\ninvolved when this shall occur. Upon receipt of such notice of\ntermination the employer may commence or resume, as the case may be,\npayment and withholding under any assignment, income execution or\ninstallment payment order whose effectiveness was postponed or suspended\nby this section.\n  2. As used in this section, "public assistance and care" shall include\nfederal supplemental security income benefits paid pursuant to title\nsixteen of the federal social security act and additional state payments\npaid pursuant to title six of article five of this chapter.\n</p>
