The tax commission, if satisfied that\nthe moneys from the purchase of such stamps have been paid from the\nstock transfer tax fund into the stock transfer incentive fund, shall\nrebate the same to the person or agent who or which purchased such\nstamps from such fund. All of the other provisions of this section\nregarding rebates shall apply to the method of rebate of tax provided\nfor by this subdivision in the same manner and with the same force and\neffect as if the language of such provisions had been incorporated in\nfull into this subdivision and had expressly referred to the claim for\nrebate of tax provided for by this subdivision, except to the extent\nthat any such provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this\nsection or is not relevant to this subdivision.\n</p>
