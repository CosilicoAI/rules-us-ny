            <p>of\nsubdivision two of this section regarding a support obligor whose case\nhas been referred to the commissioner for enforcement pursuant to this\nsection. The office of temporary and disability assistance or the\nsupport collection unit, as applicable, may redisclose such information\nonly to the extent necessary to secure the collection of support arrears\nfrom such obligor.\n  6. Activities to enforce support arrears undertaken by the department\npursuant to this section shall not in any way limit, restrict or impair\nthe office of temporary and disability assistance from exercising its\nauthority to enforce support arrears under applicable laws; provided,\nhowever, that the department and the office of temporary and disability\nassistance shall coordinate their support enforcement activities in a\nway designed to minimize duplication of effort and maximize collection\nof support arrears.\n  7. If, following referral of an obligor's case to the commissioner,\nsuch obligor commences an administrative or quasi-judicial proceeding or\nany civil proceeding against the department or the commissioner\nchallenging such referral, then the office of temporary and disability\nassistance and the commissioner of the office of temporary and\ndisability assistance shall be substituted as respondents or defendants\nin such proceeding, as the case may be. The department shall be bound by\nany decision in such proceeding which is no longer subject to\nadministrative or quasi-judicial review. Neither the department nor the\ncommissioner shall be liable for any damages sustained by reason of such\nreferral.\n  8. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a payment of\nsupport arrears made to the department pursuant to the provisions of\nthis section shall be deemed to be a payment of such arrears to the\noffice of temporary and disability assistance or its fiscal agent.\n</p>
