In any proceeding brought\nto enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the\nprovisions of this subsection, the finding of the tax commission made as\nherein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall\nbe for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.\n</p>
