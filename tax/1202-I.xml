At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be in a sum\nsufficient to cover the taxes, interests, and penalties stated in such\ndetermination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in\nthe prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall\nnot be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition\nprecedent to the application.\n  (7) Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously,\nillegally, or unconstitutionally collected and application for the\nrefund thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers, and\nsuch officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such\nrefund, such determination shall be reviewable by a proceeding under\narticle seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided,\nhowever, that such proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the\ngiving of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax\ndue was not previously made, and that an undertaking is filed with the\nproper fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such sureties\nas a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if\nsuch proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will\npay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such\nproceeding.\n  (8) Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with\nintent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made\nafter the expiration of more than three years from the date of the\nfiling of a return, provided, however, that where no return has been\nfiled as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.\n  (9) All revenues resulting from the imposition of the tax under the\nlocal laws shall be paid into the treasury of the county of Schuyler and\nshall be credited to and deposited in the general fund of the county,\nthereafter to be allocated for tourist and convention development in the\ncounty of Schuyler and the surrounding tourist region; provided,\nhowever, that such local laws shall provide that the county shall be\nauthorized to retain up to a maximum of five percent of such revenue to\ndefer the necessary expenses of the county in administering such tax.\nThe revenue derived from the tax, after deducting the amount provided\nfor administering such tax, as so authorized by local law, shall be\nallocated to enhance the general economy of the county of Schuyler, its\ncities, towns and villages, and the general economy of the tourist\nregion in which Schuyler county is located, through promotion of tourist\nactivities, conventions, track shows, special events, and other directly\nrelated and supporting activities; provided, however, that a maximum of\nseventy-five percent of the revenue derived from the tax may be\nallocated by the Schuyler county legislature for regional promotion of\ntourism.\n  (10) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to\nany person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of this\nsection and the application of such provision to other persons or\ncircumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n</p>
