            <p>General.--If upon examination of a\ntaxpayer's return under this article the tax commission determines that\nthere is a deficiency of income tax, it may mail a notice of deficiency\nto the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file an income tax return\nrequired under this article, the tax commission is authorized to\nestimate the taxpayer's New York taxable income and tax thereon, from\nany information in its possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to\nthe taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or\nregistered mail to the taxpayer at his last known address in or out of\nthis state. If a husband and wife are jointly liable for tax, a notice\nof deficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the tax\ncommission has been notified by either spouse that separate residences\nhave been established, then, in lieu of the single joint notice, a\nduplicate original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each spouse at\nhis or her last known address in or out of this state. If the taxpayer\nis deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be\nmailed to his last known address in or out of this state, unless the tax\ncommission has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary\nrelationship with respect to the taxpayer.\n</p>
