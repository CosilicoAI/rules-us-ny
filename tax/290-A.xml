Except as otherwise provided in this section, all of the provisions\nof this article shall apply to the tax surcharge imposed by this section\nwith such modifications as may be necessary to adapt such language to\nthe tax surcharge imposed by this section. Such provisions shall apply\nwith the same force and effect as if those provisions had been set forth\nin full in this section except to the extent that any provision is\neither inconsistent with a provision of this section or not relevant to\nthe tax surcharge imposed by this section, and to that end a reference\nin this article to the tax surcharge imposed by section two hundred\nninety shall be read as a reference to the tax surcharge imposed by this\nsection, and to the sum of such tax and such tax surcharge in the case\nof those provisions requiring such reading in order to effectuate the\npurposes of this provision, unless a different meaning is clearly\nrequired.\n</p>
