However, the amount so\nprescribed may not be less than twelve thousand dollars, excluding\npenalty and interest, except that with respect to controversies arising\nout of taxes imposed by article twenty-eight or pursuant to the\nauthority of article twenty-nine of this chapter, the amount so\nprescribed shall not be less than twenty-five thousand dollars,\nexcluding penalty and interest. The option to proceed in the small\nclaims unit shall be determined by the petitioner. At any time prior to\nthe conclusion of a hearing in the small claims unit, a petitioner may\nby written notice to the secretary to the tax appeals tribunal\ndiscontinue such small claims proceeding and request that it be\ntransferred to a proceeding conducted before an administrative law\njudge.

The hearing in the small\nclaims part shall be informal and such evidence and testimony that the\npresiding officer of the small claims proceeding deems necessary or\ndesirable for a just and equitable determination shall be heard or\nreceived.

However, the tax appeals tribunal\nmay order a rehearing upon proof or allegation of misconduct by the\npresiding officer of the small claims proceeding. The division shall not\nbe required to publish determinations issued by the small claims unit\nand such determinations of the small claims unit shall not be cited,\nshall not be considered as precedent nor be given any force or effect in\nany other proceeding conducted pursuant to the authority of the division\nor in any other judicial proceedings conducted in this state.\n</p>
