            <p>If, due to the circumstances of delivery, it is not possible to\nissue a certification required under this subdivision at the time of\ndelivery of motor fuel, the tax commission may authorize the delivery of\nthe certification required under this paragraph at a time after the\ndelivery of the motor fuel which is the subject of the sale under the\nlimited circumstances it shall prescribe and upon such terms and\nconditions it shall deem necessary to ensure collection of the taxes\nimposed by this article and the tax imposed by section eleven hundred\ntwo of this chapter.\n  * 4. Upon each sale of motor fuel, other than a sale that is otherwise\nexempt under this article, the distributor must charge the tax imposed\nby this article to the purchaser on each gallon sold. If the taxes\nimposed by this article have not already been assumed or paid by a\ndistributor on any quantity of such fuel for any reason, including, but\nnot limited to, the expansion of such fuel as a result of temperature\nfluctuation, the distributor must remit such taxes to the commissioner\non the return for the period in which such sale was made.\n  * NB Effective September 1, 2023\n</p>
