Upon the\ncommencement of such proceeding, the sending of such notice of refusal\nto answer shall be subject to order of the court in which the proceeding\nwas brought in a manner and on such terms as the court may deem just. If\na proceeding is not brought within ten days, notice of refusal shall\nthereupon be sent as provided herein.\n</p>
