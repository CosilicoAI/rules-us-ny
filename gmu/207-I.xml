Such\nsupplemental retirement allowance under such subdivisions a and b shall\nbe payable on the basis provided for herein, commencing with a payment\nfor the month of October, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and continuing\nthrough the month of September, nineteen hundred seventy-three, except\nthat in the case of pensioners of a pension or retirement system of a\npaid police department of a city having a population of one million or\nmore, such payments shall continue monthly thereafter.\n  a. The supplemental retirement allowance provided for in this\nsubdivision and in subdivision b of this section shall be a percentage\nof the retirement allowance computed without optional modification and\nshall be determined on the basis of the consumer price index (all items\n-- United States city average), published by the United States Bureau of\nLabor Statistics.
