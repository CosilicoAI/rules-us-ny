If the project consists of\nnew construction, the land value for purposes of determining exemptions\npermitted by this section shall be the lesser of the assessed valuation\nimmediately prior to commencement of construction or the assessed\nvaluation of the land appearing on the assessment roll in the first year\nafter completion of construction. Such exemption may only be made\navailable where the urban development action area project includes the\nconstruction of a new structure or the renovation, rehabilitation or\nconversion of an existing structure where the cost of such renovation,\nrehabilitation or construction is at least equal to one hundred percent\nof the assessed value of such structure as determined in the tax year\nimmediately preceding the governing body's grant of tax exemption to\nsuch project. Any lease of real property and appurtenances thereto for a\nperiod not exceeding twenty years shall require payments to the\nmunicipality in lieu of taxes. Such additional payments shall be\nrequired to be in equal annual or biennial escalating amounts over the\nlife of any lease for a period not exceeding twenty years so as to\nensure that payments in lieu of taxes made during the final year of such\nlease shall be equal to all local and municipal taxes. All renewals of\nany lease shall include provision for payment of rental and in lieu of\ntax payments greater than or equal to those required during the final\nyear of the original lease. Any lease of real property and appurtenances\nthereto for a period in excess of twenty years but not exceeding\nninety-nine years shall require payments in lieu of taxes.
