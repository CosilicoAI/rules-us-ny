Any certificate issued to\nsuch volunteer firefighter as provided in section two hundred two of\nthis article shall credit him with the period of any such leave of\nabsence in the same manner as if he had served during such period as a\nmember of his fire company or department and had rendered service in all\nrespects as specified in section two hundred of this article.

During the period of\nany such leave of absence such volunteer firefighter shall not perform\nany services or duties as a volunteer firefighter except for services\nand duties performed pursuant to subdivision one-a of this section.\n  1-a. A volunteer firefighter on leave of absence, pursuant to this\nsection, may perform services and duties as a volunteer firefighter\nduring any period in which the armed forces of the United States grants\nthe volunteer firefighter a temporary leave from military service,\nprovided that such services and duties would not violate any law,\nregulation, rule or order of the United States or of the armed forces of\nthe United States.
