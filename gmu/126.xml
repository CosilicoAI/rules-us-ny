In any city in which a board of estimate and\napportionment or other board is required to approve appropriations for\npublic purposes, the resolution of the governing board to establish a\npublic general hospital shall be effective only after the necessary\nappropriation for lands and buildings for such public general hospital\nshall have been approved by said board of estimate and apportionment or\nother board, in the same manner and by the same vote by which it is\nrequired by law to approve other appropriations for public purposes.\nWhen the governing board of any county, town, city or village shall have\nvoted to establish a public general hospital, such governing board shall\nhave the following powers:\n  1.

To accept and hold in trust for the county, town, city or village\nof which it is the governing board, any grant or devise of land, or any\ngift or bequest of money or other personal property, or any donation to\nbe applied, principal or income, or both, for the benefit of said\nhospital, and apply the same in accordance with the terms of the gift.\n  4. Such governing board may also adopt a resolution authorizing the\nboard of managers of such hospital to elect a treasurer, who shall be\nbonded, and who shall establish an account in a bank or banks in the\nname of such hospital and deposit in such account all money received or\ncollected by such hospital and pay therefrom all bills, accounts, and\nsalaries and wages, when approved by the board of managers of such\nhospital, within the budget limits, by resolution subject to such\nregulations as the governing board may deem proper; provided, however,\nthat the proceeds, inclusive of premiums, from the sale of bonds, bond\nanticipation notes, capital notes or budget notes shall be deposited in\na special account in a bank or trust company located and authorized to\ndo business in this state, shall not be commingled with other funds, and\nshall be expended only for the object or purpose for which such\nobligations were issued.\n</p>
