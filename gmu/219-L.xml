The governing board of a political subdivision which intends to\nadopt a service award program shall engage the services of the program\nactuary designated by the comptroller for the purpose of determining the\nestimated annual cost of the program.

Following such determination of the estimated annual cost of a\nservice award program, the program may be adopted only by resolution of\nthe governing board of a political subdivision receiving the affirmative\nvote of at least sixty percent of the governing board and the approval\nof a proposition authorizing the adoption of the program at a referendum\nof the electors of the political subdivision.\n  5.
