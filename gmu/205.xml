If an active member of a volunteer fire company in any\ncity, incorporated village or in any fire district of a town outside of\nan incorporated village or in any part of a town protected by a\nvolunteer fire company incorporated under the provisions of the\nmembership corporations law, or if an active member of any duly\norganized volunteer fire company, dies from injuries incurred while in\nthe performance of his or her duties as such firefighter or as a member\nof a fire department emergency relief squad, a fire police squad or a\nfire patrol within one year thereafter, the city, village, fire district\nor town which is responsible as provided in subdivision four of this\nsection shall pay as follows:\n  a. If such volunteer firefighter is a member of a volunteer fire\ncompany located in any city in which a pension fund is maintained, the\nrelatives of such volunteer firefighter shall be entitled to a pension\nin the same manner and at the same rates as if he or she were a member\nof the paid fire department of such city.\n  b. If in any other place the sum of three thousand dollars shall be\npaid to the widow or widower of such deceased volunteer firefighter or\nto the executor or administrator of his or her estate if he or she is\nnot survived by a widow or widower. In addition there shall be paid to\nthe widow or widower of such volunteer firefighter for the benefit of\nsuch child or children the sum of twenty-five dollars a month for each\nsurviving child, including a posthumous child, of such deceased\nfirefighter under the age of eighteen years, but not more than a total\nof fifty dollars a month for all such children, or if the decedent be\nnot survived by a widow or widower, or if he or she dies before the\npayments cease, then such payments for a child or children shall be made\nto their guardian or to relatives with whom they are living for their\nbenefit.\n  2. Any such volunteer firefighter who shall become permanently\nincapacitated for performing the full duties of a volunteer firefighter\nby reason of disease or disability caused or induced by actual\nperformance of the duties of his or her position, without fault or\nmisconduct on his or her part, shall\n  a. If a member of a volunteer fire company located in any city in\nwhich a pension fund is maintained, be paid a pension in the same manner\nand at the same rate as if he or she were a member of the paid fire\ndepartment of such city.\n  b. If a member of a volunteer fire company in any other place, be paid\none-half the amount which would have been payable in case of death to\nhis or her executor or administrator under the provisions of subdivision\none of this section;\n  Provided, however, that if such volunteer firefighter shall at the\nexpiration of the disability payments provided for in subdivision three\nof this section be totally incapacitated to engage in any occupation for\nremuneration or profit by reason of disease or disability caused by\nactual performance of the duties of his or her position, without fault\nor misconduct on his or her part, he or she shall be paid the sum of\nfifteen dollars per week during the period thereafter that such total\nincapacity shall continue and, in addition thereto, during such period\nthere shall be paid to him or her for the benefit of his or her child or\nchildren the sum of twelve dollars fifty cents a month for each child\nunder the age of eighteen years, but not more than a total of\ntwenty-five dollars a month for all such children, but no payment on\naccount of a child shall continue after such child shall have attained\nthe age of eighteen years. In the event payments to a volunteer\nfirefighter and his or her children on account of total incapacity, as\nheretofore in this subdivision provided, shall not have amounted to the\nsum to which he or she would otherwise have been entitled on account of\npermanent incapacity for performing the full duties of a volunteer\nfirefighter and he or she shall be found to have recovered to such\nextent that he or she is no longer totally incapacitated but is still\npermanently incapacitated for performing the full duties of a volunteer\nfirefighter, there shall be paid to him or her the difference between\nthe payments already made to him or her for his or her own account and\nfor the account of his or her children and the amount to which he or she\nwould be entitled under this subdivision on account of permanent\nincapacity for performing the full duties of a volunteer firefighter.\nThe authorities having jurisdiction to audit the claim of any volunteer\nfirefighter claiming total disability benefits under this subdivision\nshall have the right to cause such injured volunteer firefighter to be\nexamined from time to time at reasonable intervals by the municipal\nhealth authorities or any physician appointed by them for that purpose\nto determine whether total disability continues and, in case a volunteer\nfirefighter receiving total disability benefits hereunder shall refuse\nto permit any such examination to be made, such authorities shall be\nauthorized to discontinue the payment of benefits to him or her until\nsuch examination is allowed.\n  3. Any such volunteer firefighter who shall receive injuries while\nperforming his or her duties as such, while in the fire house, while\ngoing to or returning from a fire by any means of travel,\ntransportation, or conveyance whatever, or while working at the fire or\nanswering a call or fire alarm or while officially engaged in testing or\ninspecting the apparatus, or equipment, or while engaged as a member of\na fire department, or fire company, emergency relief squad or fire\npolice squad, or fire patrol or while attending a fire school, or while\ninstructing or being instructed in fire duties or while attending any\ndrill or parade or inspection in which his or her company or department\nis engaged, or while engaged in emergency work not related to fire\nextinguishment or prevention or going to or returning therefrom when\nduly authorized to participate therein, so as to necessitate medical or\nother lawful remedial treatment or prevent him or her from following his\nor her usual vocation on account thereof, shall be reimbursed for such\nsums as are actually and necessarily paid for medical or other lawful\nremedial treatment, not exceeding five hundred dollars. He or she shall\nalso be compensated for the time he or she was actually and necessarily\nprevented from following his or her vocation or for the time of his or\nher disability on account of such injuries, at the rate of thirty-six\ndollars per week not to exceed one thousand eight hundred dollars.\n  Notice of an injury or death for which benefits are payable under this\nsection shall be given to the municipal corporation or fire district\nresponsible for the payment thereof within thirty days after receiving\nsuch injury, and also in case of the death of the volunteer firefighter\nresulting from such injury within thirty days after such death. Such\nnotice may be given by any person claiming to be entitled to such\nbenefits or by someone in his or her behalf. The notice shall be in\nwriting, shall contain the name and address of the volunteer\nfirefighter, and state in ordinary language the time, place, nature and\ncause of the injury and shall be signed by him or her or by a person on\nhis or her behalf or, in case of death, by any one or more of his or her\ndependents, or by a person on their behalf. The notice shall be given to\nthe comptroller or chief financial officer of the city, the clerk of the\nvillage, the secretary of the fire district, or the town clerk of the\ntown, as the case may be, by delivering it to such officer or by\nregistered letter properly addressed to such officer. The failure to\ngive notice of injury or notice of death shall be a bar to any claim\nunder this section. Failure to give notice of such injury or death\nwithin such thirty day period may be excused by the county judge who\nwould have jurisdiction of a controversy under this section, upon\npetition and notice in the manner provided in subdivision five of this\nsection, either upon the ground that for some sufficient reason the\nnotice had not been given, or that any member of a body in charge of, or\nany officer of the fire department or fire company had knowledge within\nsuch thirty day period, of the injuries or death, or that the municipal\ncorporation or fire district has not been prejudiced by a delay in\ngiving such notice.\n  Any such volunteer firefighter who shall receive injuries as aforesaid\nshall, when certified by the chief or other executive officer of the\nfire department or by the appropriate administrative officers under whom\nhe or she serves, be received by any public, private, or semi-private\nhospital for care and treatment at the usual ward or semi-private\npatient rates, including charges at the prevailing ward or semi-private\npatient rates for necessary nursing, laboratory tests, x-ray\nexaminations and physical therapy, or, in case any such hospital has a\ncontract with the municipality served by such volunteer firefighter,\nthen at the rates specified in such contract.\n  Within two years after receiving the injury, or if death results\ntherefrom within two years after such death, a claim for the benefits\nunder this section shall be filed with the same officer to whom a notice\nof an injury must be given, as aforesaid. The claim shall be in\nsubstantially the same form and shall give substantially the same\ninformation as is required to be given in a claim under the provisions\nof section twenty-eight of the workers' compensation law.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any such claim need not\nbe sworn to, verified or acknowledged.\n  Payments of weekly benefits under this section shall commence within\nfifteen days after th</p>
