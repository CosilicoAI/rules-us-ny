            <p>When a patient who is not the concern of the public welfare\ncommissioner is admitted, the superintendent shall cause to be made such\ninquiry as he may deem necessary relative to the ability of such\npatient, and of the relatives legally liable for his support, to pay for\nhis care and treatment. If he finds that such patient, or said\nrelatives, are able to pay for his care and treatment in whole or in\npart, an order shall be made by the superintendent directing such\npatient, or said relatives, to pay to the treasurer of such hospital for\nthe support of such patient a specified sum per week, in proportion to\ntheir financial ability, but such sum shall not exceed the actual cost\nof maintenance. The superintendent shall have the same power and\nauthority to collect such sums from the patient, or his relatives\nlegally liable for his support, as is possessed by a public welfare\nofficial in like circumstances. If the superintendent find that such\npatient, or his said relatives, are not able to pay, either in whole or\nin part, for his care and treatment in such hospital, the unpaid cost of\nhis maintenance shall become a charge upon the county or city by which\nthe hospital is maintained, but may be subject to chargeback to another\npublic welfare district pursuant to the provisions of the social welfare\nlaw. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any person\nadmitted for care and treatment of tuberculosis, as defined and provided\nfor in the public health law.\n</p>
