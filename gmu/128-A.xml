          <p>  § 128-a. Petty cash fund.  1. The board of managers of a public\ngeneral hospital may, by resolution, establish a revolving petty cash\nfund for any officer in such amount as the board may determine. Any such\npetty cash fund shall continue in existence from year to year until\nabolished by the board of managers.\n  2. Expenditures from the petty cash fund may be made only for payment,\nin advance of audit, of properly itemized and verified or certified\nclaims for materials, supplies or services, other than employment,\nfurnished to the hospital for the conduct of its affairs and upon terms\ncalling for payment to the vendor upon the delivery of any such\nmaterials or supplies or the rendering of any such services; provided,\nhowever, that moneys in such fund also may be used for the purpose of\nmaking change when the same is required in the performance of official\nduties. At the time of any payment from such fund, the officer for whom\nthe fund was established shall require delivery to him of a claim in\nform sufficient for audit as required by law. A list of all expenditures\nmade from any such petty cash fund, together with the claims supporting\nsuch expenditures, shall be presented periodically to the board of\nmanagers for audit. The board of managers shall direct the treasurer to\nreimburse such petty cash fund from the appropriate budgetary item or\nitems, in an amount equal to the total of such claims which it shall so\naudit and allow. Any claim or portion thereof which the board shall\nrefuse to allow shall be the personal liability of the particular\nofficer for whom such petty cash fund was established, who shall\npromptly reimburse the petty cash fund in the amount disallowed.  If\nreimbursement has not been made by the time of the first payment of\nsalary to such officer following the disallowance, the amounts\ndisallowed shall be withheld from salary payment and, if necessary,\nsubsequent salary payments, and paid into the petty cash fund until the\nsame has been fully reimbursed.\n</p>
