There exist in many\nmunicipalities within this state residential, non-residential,\ncommercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which\nare slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas\nbecause of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating\nconditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible\nphysical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and\ngrowing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and\nwelfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile\ndelinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate\nexpenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and\nconstitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their\neconomic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of\npublic revenues.\n  In order to protect and promote the safety, health, morals and welfare\nof the people of the state and to promote the sound growth and\ndevelopment of our municipalities, it is necessary to correct such\nsubstandard, insanitary, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating\nconditions, factors and characteristics by the clearance, replanning,\nreconstruction, redevelopment, rehabilitation, restoration or\nconservation of such areas, the undertaking of public and private\nimprovement programs related thereto and the encouragement of\nparticipation in these programs by private enterprise.\n  It is necessary for the accomplishment of such purposes to grant\nmunicipalities of this state the rights and powers provided in this\narticle. The use of such rights and powers to correct such conditions,\nfactors and characteristics and to eliminate or prevent the development\nand spread of deterioration and blight through the clearance,\nreplanning, reconstruction, rehabilitation, conservation or renewal of\nsuch areas, for residential, commercial, industrial, community, public\nand other uses is a public use and public purpose essential to the\npublic interest, and for which public funds may be expended.\n</p>
