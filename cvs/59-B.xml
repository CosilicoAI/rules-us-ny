Promotion shall be based on merit and fitness as determined by\ncompetitive examination, due weight being given to seniority. The\nprevious training and experience of the candidates, and performance\nratings where available, may be considered and given due weight as\nfactors in determining the relative merit and fitness of candidates for\npromotion.\n  3. Any permanent competitive employee holding a provisional or\ndiscretionary appointment in the affected supervisory titles of the\nemergency medical service described in subdivision one of this section\nshall be given the opportunity to participate in a competitive\npromotional examination for the next higher level title.\n  4. Except as provided above, the provisions of this chapter shall\napply to employees covered by this section.\n</p>
