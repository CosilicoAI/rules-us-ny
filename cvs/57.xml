          <p>  § 57. Continuous recruitment for certain positions. Notwithstanding\nany other provisions of this chapter or any other law, the civil service\ndepartment or a municipal commission may establish a continuing eligible\nlist for any class of positions for which it finds such lists\nappropriate. The civil service department may only establish continuing\neligible lists for any class of positions filled through open\ncompetitive examination. Names of eligibles shall be inserted in such\nlist from time to time as applicants are tested and found qualified in\nexaminations held at such intervals as may be prescribed by the civil\nservice department or municipal commission having jurisdiction. Such\nsuccessive examinations shall, so far as practicable, be constructed and\nrated so as to be equivalent tests of the merit and fitness of\ncandidates. The name of any candidate who passes any such examination\nand who is otherwise qualified shall be placed on the continuing\neligible list in the rank corresponding to his or her final rating on\nsuch examination. The period of eligibility of successful candidates for\ncertification and appointment from such continuing eligible list, as a\nresult of any such examination, shall be fixed by the civil service\ndepartment or municipal commission but, except as a list may reach an\nannounced terminal date, such period shall not be less than one year;\nnor shall such period of eligibility exceed four years. Subject to such\nconditions and limitations as the civil service department or municipal\ncommission may prescribe, a candidate may take more than one such\nexamination; provided, however, that no such candidate shall be\ncertified simultaneously with more than one rank on the continuing\neligible list. With respect to any candidate who applies for and is\ngranted additional credit in any such examination as a disabled or\nnon-disabled veteran, and for the limited purpose of granting such\nadditional credit, the eligible list shall be deemed to be established\non the date on which his or her name is added thereto.\n</p>
