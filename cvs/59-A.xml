        <content>
          <p>  § 59-a. Placement of detectives and investigators in classified\nservice.  1. The legislature hereby finds and declares that the\ncontinued, uninterrupted, adequate and efficient operation of detective\nand investigative units in local police, correction or sheriffs\ndepartments is necessary for the general welfare of the people; that\nsuch adequate operation involves and requires personnel with highly\nspecialized ability, skill, training, and knowledge; that local civil\nservice commissions may decide to classify such positions where they\nconstitute bona fide civil service positions as evidenced by factors\nincluding enhanced pay, benefits, and dignity of position; that while\ncompetitive examination has been deemed practicable for certain\ndetective and investigator positions, to require such examination for\nvalid appointment of current long standing employees would irreparably\ndisorganize detective or investigative operations, endanger the public\nsafety, interrupt the continuity and effective performance of important\ninvestigatory operations.\n  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any provisions to\nthe contrary contained in any general, special, or local laws, any\nperson holding a permanent competitive class appointment as a police\nofficer, correction officer of any rank or deputy sheriff in a police\nforce, police department or sheriffs department in a jurisdiction other\nthan a city with a population of one million or more or the state\ndepartment of corrections and community supervision, who was serving in\na detective or investigator capacity, as designated by such police\nforce, police department or sheriffs department, on the date such\nposition was classified by the local civil service commission having\njurisdiction and for at least eighteen months immediately preceding such\ndate, shall receive a permanent appointment to a detective or\ninvestigator position, in such title as may be properly classified by\nthe local civil service commission having jurisdiction, without further\nexamination or qualifications and shall have all the rights and\nprivileges of the jurisdictional class to which such position may be\nallocated.\n</p>
