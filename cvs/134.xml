Upon the approval of the director of the budget a\nmember of the state police may be considered to have worked, for the\npurpose of determining overtime compensation pursuant to the provisions\nof this section, a minimum of four hours each time they are recalled to\nwork overtime after completing their scheduled work period and leaving\ntheir scheduled work station or may be considered to have worked a\nminimum of two hours each time they are scheduled to return and returns\nto duty to work overtime for the purpose of making an appearance in\ncourt after completing their regularly scheduled work period and leaving\ntheir regularly scheduled work station. Upon the approval of the\ndirector of the budget an employee may be considered to have worked, for\nthe purpose of determining overtime compensation pursuant to the\nprovisions of this section, a minimum of one-half day each time they are\nrecalled to work overtime after completing their scheduled work period\nand leaving their scheduled work station; provided, however, that,\nsubject to the terms of an agreement negotiated between the state and an\nemployee organization pursuant to article fourteen of the civil service\nlaw, an employee recalled to work may be considered to have worked less\nthan a minimum of one-half day and an employee recalled to work more\nthan once during a period of one-half day commencing with the onset of\nthe initial recall will not be entitled to more than one-half day of\novertime credit unless more than one-half day is actually worked. When\nan employee shall work overtime in a position which has a title which is\nallocated to a lower salary grade than the salary grade to which the\ntitle of their regular position is allocated, they shall receive\novertime compensation at one and one-half times the hourly rate of pay\nof the maximum salary of the grade of the position in which they shall\nwork overtime, or such maximum salary plus the additional increment or\nincrements, if they would be entitled to such additional increment or\nincrements were they then appointed to such position; provided, however,\nthat when such hourly rate exceeds the hourly rate of pay received by\nthem in their regular position, they shall receive one and one-half\ntimes the hourly rate of their regular position. When an employee works\novertime in a position allocated to a salary grade higher than the\nsalary grade to which their regular position is allocated, they shall\nreceive overtime compensation at one and one-half times the hourly rate\nof pay of the rate of compensation to which he would be entitled if they\nwere permanently promoted to the position in which such overtime work is\nperformed.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where an\nagreement between the state and an employee organization entered into\npursuant to article fourteen of this chapter so provides that such\nofficers and employees covered by such agreement shall receive overtime\ncompensation at a rate of two times the hourly rate of pay received by\nsuch employee in their regular position for such hours of work that\nqualify for such payment under the terms of such agreement.\n  2.

The amount received as overtime compensation under this section\nshall be regarded as salary or compensation for any of the purposes of\nany pension or retirement system in which the employee receiving the\nsame is a member. Overtime compensation shall not be regarded as salary\nor compensation for the purpose of determining the right to any increase\nof salary or any salary increment on account of length of service or\notherwise. No such overtime compensation shall be construed to\nconstitute a promotion or to increase any compensation which a public\nemployee may receive pursuant to section six of chapter six hundred\neight of the laws of nineteen hundred fifty-two.\n  4. The director of the budget shall promulgate, and may from time to\ntime amend or rescind, rules and regulations for carrying into effect\nthe provisions of this section.

Such rules and regulations may exclude any title\nor individual position or positions, when the nature of the duties\nperformed or the difficulty of maintaining adequate time controls makes\nit impracticable to apply to such title or individual position or\npositions the provisions of this section which prescribe a work week for\nbasic salary and provide for overtime compensation.\n  5. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary,\nemployees in any title or individual position or positions ineligible to\naccrue overtime credits under the rules and regulations promulgated by\nthe director of the budget pursuant to the provisions of this section\nwho are required to work beyond a normal work week may be granted\nadditional compensation. Such compensation shall be paid upon approval\nby the director of the budget and at a rate established by the director\nof the budget, provided however, that such additional compensation shall\nnot exceed twelve per cent of the employee's basic salary. Such\ncompensation shall be paid in addition to and shall not be a part of the\nemployee's basic annual salary, and shall not affect or impair any\nperformance advances or other rights or benefits to which the employee\nmay be entitled under the provisions of this chapter, provided however,\nthat any differential payable pursuant to this subdivision shall be\nincluded as compensation for retirement purposes.\n  6. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, any\nemployee in any title or individual position ineligible to accrue\novertime credits under the rules and regulations promulgated by the\ndirector of the budget pursuant to the provisions of this section who is\nrequired to work beyond a normal workweek during a period deemed by the\ndirector of the budget to be an extreme emergency, may be granted\nadditional compensation upon the approval of and at a rate established\nby the director of the budget; provided, however, that such additional\ncompensation shall not exceed one and one-half times the</p>
