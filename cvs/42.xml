With respect to civil divisions of the state whose populations,\naccording to the latest federal decennial census or latest federal\nspecial population census, are less than five thousand and, with respect\nto those civil divisions whose populations are not determined as such by\nthe federal bureau of the census, whose populations are estimated by\ntheir respective governing bodies to be less than five thousand, the\nstate commission shall, on or before July first, nineteen hundred\nsixty-one, promulgate standards for determining the practicality of\nexamination, which it may from time to time thereafter amend, and shall\nalso provide information and advice to municipal commissions, to enable\nsuch commissions to utilize the provisions of this section, when\nappropriate, in order to enable such civil subdivisions to recruit and\nretain in their employ competent and qualified persons.\n  2-a. The state or municipal civil service commission by appropriate\namendments to its rules shall designate among positions in the\nnon-competitive class in its jurisdiction those positions which are\nconfidential or require the performance of functions influencing policy.\n</p>
