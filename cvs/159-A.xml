          <p>  § 159-a. Disability program. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or\nregulation to the contrary, where an agreement between the state and an\nemployee organization entered into pursuant to article fourteen of this\nchapter so provides on behalf of employees in positions serving in the\ncollective negotiating unit created by chapter four hundred three of the\nlaws of nineteen hundred eighty-three, the director of employee\nrelations is authorized to establish and implement a disability program\nthat will provide long term income protection for such employees and the\npresident is empowered to establish regulations to effect such\nimplementation. No regulation shall be adopted, repealed or amended, and\nno other action taken with respect to such employees or such\nimplementation without the approval of the director of employee\nrelations. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the\ncontrary, any employee who participates in or is covered by a disability\nprogram authorized by this section shall receive retirement service\ncredit not to exceed six months during the period that he or she is\nreceiving the short term disability benefit under such program on the\nsame basis and at the same rate as such employee would receive such\ncredit were he or she on sick leave at half pay for the period of time\nfor which such employee would have been entitled to such sick leave at\nhalf pay had the sick leave policy supplemented by the short term\ndisability program remained in effect.\n</p>
