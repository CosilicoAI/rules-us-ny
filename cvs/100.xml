            <p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, no disbursing or\nauditing officer of the state or of any civil division thereof shall\napprove or pay or take any part in approving or paying any salary or\ncompensation for personal service to any person holding an office or\nposition in the classified service unless the voucher or payroll\ntherefor bears the certificate of the civil service department or\nmunicipal commission having jurisdiction that the persons named therein\nare employed in their respective positions in accordance with law and\nrules made pursuant to law. The certificate of municipal commissions\nshall also include a statement of membership in an appropriate\nretirement system where such membership is mandatory. Such certificate\nmay be executed for and on behalf of such department or commission, as\nthe case may be, by an officer or employee thereof duly designated in\nwriting for that purpose.  Such certificate may, for cause, be withheld\nfrom an entire payroll or from any item or items therein. If the\ndepartment or municipal commission finds that any person has been\npromoted, transferred, assigned, reinstated or otherwise employed in\nviolation of this chapter or rules made pursuant thereto, it shall so\nnotify the appropriate disbursing and auditing officers who thereafter\nshall not pay or approve the payment of any salary or compensation to\nsuch person; and nothing contained in this section shall be construed to\nauthorize any officer to approve or pay salary or compensation to any\nperson contrary to such a notice. If, however, permission is granted by\nthe department to a state agency or state department to certify directly\nto the department of audit and control that the persons named in the\ncertification are employed in their respective positions in accordance\nwith law and rules made pursuant to law, the department need not certify\nany voucher or payroll but may at any time thereafter examine such\npayroll or voucher and revoke any ...</p>

In such cases the names of such officers and\nemployees shall be submitted for certification on the first payroll on\nwhich they appear under such appointment, reinstatement, or other new\nstatus or salary or compensation; provided, however, that in the case of\nschool districts other than city school districts, pending such\ncertification by the department or commission as to persons not so\npreviously certified, audit and payment of salary or compensation may be\nmade for a period not exceeding two calendar months after the\nappointment, reinstatement or other change of status or salary or\ncompensation of such persons if notice thereof in writing is forwarded\nto the civil service department within fifteen calendar days after such\nappointment, reinstatement or other change of status or salary or\ncompensation occurs.\n</p>

No further\ncertification shall be necessary for the payment of compensation to any\nsuch person so long as his status remains unchanged and during the\nstated limited period, if any, of his employment. The civil service\ndepartment, however, may at any time examine the payroll of such\ndepartment, agency or authority for any pay period, and shall examine\nsuch a payroll at least once each year to determine that all persons\nemployed in such department, agency or authority are employed in\naccordance with law and rules.\n</p>
