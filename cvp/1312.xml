            <p>in an action relating\nto real property, that entry of the requested order will not\nsubstantially diminish, impair, or terminate the lawful property\ninterest in such real property of any person or persons other than the\ndefendant or defendants.\n  4. Upon motion of any party against whom a provisional remedy granted\npursuant to this article is in effect, the court may issue an order\nmodifying or vacating such provisional remedy if necessary to permit the\nmoving party to obtain funds for the payment of reasonable living\nexpenses, other costs or expenses related to the maintenance, operation,\nor preservation of property which is the subject of any such provisional\nremedy or reasonable and bona fide attorneys' fees and expenses for the\nrepresentation of the defendant in the forfeiture proceeding or in a\nrelated criminal matter relating thereto, payment for which is not\notherwise available from assets of the defendant which are not subject\nto such provisional remedy. Any such motion shall be supported by an\naffidavit establishing the unavailability of other assets of the moving\nparty which are not the subject of such provisional remedy for payment\nof such expenses or fees. That funds sought to be released under this\nsubdivision are alleged to be the proceeds, substituted proceeds,\ninstrumentality of a crime or real property instrumentality of a crime\nshall not be a factor for the court in considering and determining a\nmotion made pursuant to this subdivision.\n</p>
