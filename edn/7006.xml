No corporation organized to practice podiatry\nshall change its name or sell its franchise or transfer its corporate\nrights directly or indirectly, by transfer of capital stock control or\notherwise, to any person or to another corporation without permission\nfrom the department and any corporation so changing its name or so\ntransferring its franchise or corporate rights without such permission\nor found guilty of violating a board of regents rule shall be deemed to\nhave forfeited its right to exist and shall be dissolved by a proceeding\nbrought by the attorney general.\n  2. Any manufacturer or merchant may sell, advertise, fit, or adjust\nproprietary foot remedies, arch supports, corrective foot appliances or\nshoes.\n  3. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of any general, special\nor local law, any licensed podiatrist who voluntarily and without the\nexpectation of monetary compensation renders first aid or emergency\ntreatment at the scene of an accident or other emergency, outside of a\nhospital or any other place having proper and necessary medical\nequipment, to a person who is unconscious, ill or injured shall not be\nliable for damages for injuries alleged to have been sustained by such\nperson or for damages for the death of such person alleged to have\noccurred by reason of an act or omission in the rendering of such first\naid or emergency treatment unless it is established that such injuries\nwere or such death was caused by gross negligence on the part of such\npodiatrist. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed or construed to\nrelieve a licensed podiatrist from liability for damages for injuries or\ndeath caused by an act or omission on the part of a podiatrist while\nrendering professional services in the normal and ordinary course of\npractice.\n  4. An unlicensed person may provide supportive services to a\npodiatrist incidental to and concurrent with such podiatrist personally\nperforming a service or procedure.
