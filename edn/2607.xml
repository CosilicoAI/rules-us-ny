Additional inspectors of elections for\neach district may be appointed for one or more of such school election\ndistricts when, in the opinion of the board, special circumstances exist\nrequiring the services of such additional inspectors. Such inspectors\nshall, before opening the polls in the election district for which they\nare appointed, organize by electing one of their number as chairperson\nand one as poll clerk. The chairperson may also appoint one of the\ninspectors as an assistant poll clerk. Each inspector shall receive for\nhis or her services a compensation to be fixed by the board of\neducation, not to exceed the basic compensation paid to inspectors of\nelection at the preceding general elections, as fixed by the governing\nbody of the city in which such school district is wholly or partly\nlocated, to be paid out of the school funds in the same manner as other\nclaims against the city school district. Notwithstanding the foregoing\nprovisions of this section, a person seventeen years of age who is\nenrolled in a school district and fulfilling the requirements of section\nthirty-two hundred seven-a of this chapter shall be eligible to be\nappointed as, and to perform the duties of, an election inspector or\npoll clerk as provided in this article.\n</p>
