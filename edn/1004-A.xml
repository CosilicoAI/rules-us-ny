The\nstate is saved the expense of his or her institutionalization in already\novercrowded state schools and facilities. The family retains closer\ncontact with him or her and is spared the anxieties naturally attaching\nto separation and institutionalization. All of these factors have also\nbeen shown to reflect tangible benefit upon individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, mental illness or a severe physical handicap\nin improving his or her overall condition. The purpose of this measure\nis to specifically encourage the development, improvement and expansion\nof such sheltered employment facilities by non-profit agencies, so that\nthe salutary effects mentioned can be expediently accomplished.\n  2.
