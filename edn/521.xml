The treasurer of each employer on receipt from the employer of the\nvoucher for deductions from the salaries of teachers as provided in this\narticle shall transmit monthly or at such times as the retirement board\nshall designate, the amount specified in such voucher to the secretary\nof the retirement board. The secretary of the retirement board after\nmaking record of all such receipts shall transmit them to the head of\nthe division of the treasury in the department of taxation and finance\nfor use according to the provisions of this article.\n  But nothing in this section shall prevent the retirement board from\nmodifying the method of collecting the contribution of members so that\nemployers may retain the amounts so deducted and have a corresponding\namount deducted from the appropriation for the support of common schools\notherwise payable to them.\n  2. The collection of employers' contributions shall be made as\nfollows:\n  a. Upon the basis of each actuarial determination and appraisal\nprovided herein, the retirement board shall annually prepare and certify\nto the commissioner of education a statement of the total amount\nnecessary to be paid by all employers for the ensuing fiscal year to the\npension accumulation and expense funds as provided under subdivision two\nof section five hundred seventeen and under section five hundred\nnineteen of this article.

Said certification shall\ninclude interest on amounts necessary to repay advances made to the\nsupplemental retirement allowance fund pursuant to subdivision f of\nsection five hundred thirty-two of this article computed from the date\nof such advances at the rate determined in accordance with paragraph f\nof this subdivision.\n  b. The commissioner of education shall include in the certificate\nwhich he files with the state comptroller showing the amount of state\nfunds apportioned to the school districts within each county for the\nsupport of common schools, a statement showing the amount to be\ncontributed by each employer in each of such counties as required under\nthis article.\n  The amount to be contributed by each employer except those who operate\nlocal district pension systems, shall be such percentage of the total\ncompensation or salaries of all teachers in his employ who are members\nof the retirement system as the aggregate amount of the normal and\ndeficiency contributions for the year shall bear to the total\ncompensation or salaries paid by all employers, except those who operate\nlocal district pension systems, to all teachers who are members of the\nretirement system.\n  c. The comptroller shall issue his warrant to the custodian of such\nfund directing such custodian to credit to the pension accumulation fund\nand expense fund respectively, from the appropriation for the support of\ncommon schools the amounts required to be made as contributions to such\nfunds by the employers as shown by the certificate of the commissioner\nof education filed with him as directed in paragraph b of this\nsubdivision.\n  d. The comptroller, in issuing his warrant to the custodian for\npayment to each county treasurer of that portion of the moneys\napportioned for the support of common schools, shall deduct therefrom an\namount equal to the amount required to be contributed by employers of\nsuch county, as shown by the certificate of the commissioner of\neducation of this state filed with the comptroller as required by\nparagraph b of this subdivision.\n  e. In order to meet the financial requirements of this article,\nemployers who obtain funds directly by taxation are hereby authorized\nand directed to levy annually such additional taxes as are required to\nprovide the funds deducted from the amounts apportioned to such\nemployers from the appropriation of the state for the support of the\ncommon schools.\n  f. Employers whose payments from the moneys apportioned from the state\nfor the support of common schools are insufficient to pay the amount due\nand owing the system, or who do not receive such payments, shall pay the\nsystem each year the amount of contributions due and owing from the\nemployer pursuant to this article within thirty days from the date a\nbill is mailed by the system. Interest, at a rate equal to the average\nyield payable on fifty-two week United States treasury bills on June\nthirtieth immediately preceding the day the bill is mailed by the\nsystem, shall accrue on the outstanding amount due and owing commencing\nwith the thirty-first day after the bill is mailed.\n  g. Whenever the system determines the contributions made by an\nemployer are less than the percentage of total compensation or salaries\nof members of the system in the employ of such employer, as required by\nthis article, such employer shall pay the system such deficiency within\nthirty days from the date a bill is mailed by the system. Interest, at a\nrate equal to the average yield payable on fifty-two week United States\ntreasury bills on June thirtieth immediately preceding the day before\nthe bill is mailed by the system, shall accrue on the outstanding amount\ndue and owing commencing with the thirty-first day after the bill is\nmailed.\n  h.

Employers whose\npayments from such appropriation are insufficient to pay the amount due\nand owing the system, or who do not receive such payments, shall be\nbilled by the system for such underpayment and shall pay the system the\namount due within thirty days from the date a bill is mailed by the\nsystem. The amount of any employer overpayment of its obligation to the\nretirement system, as determined by such system shall be a credit to the\nemployer and shall reduce by an equal amount thereof the initial payment\nto be made by such employer to such system on the next succeeding\nSeptember fifteenth.\n  i.
