An examination and health history of any child may\nbe required by the local school authorities at any time in their\ndiscretion to promote the educational interests of such child. Each\ncertificate shall be signed by a duly licensed physician, physician\nassistant, or nurse practitioner, who is authorized by law to practice\nin this state, and consistent with subdivision three of section six\nthousand nine hundred two of this chapter, or by a duly licensed\nphysician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, who is authorized\nto practice in the jurisdiction in which the examination was given,\nprovided that the commissioner has determined that such jurisdiction has\nstandards of licensure and practice comparable to those of New York.\nEach such certificate shall describe the condition of the student when\nthe examination was made, which shall not be more than twelve months\nprior to the commencement of the school year in which the examination is\nrequired, and shall state whether such student is in a fit condition of\nhealth to permit his or her attendance at the public schools. The\nexamination may include a diabetes risk analysis. Each such certificate\nshall also state the student's body mass index (BMI) and weight status\ncategory. For purposes of this section, BMI is computed as the weight in\nkilograms divided by the square of height in meters or the weight in\npounds divided by the square of height in inches multiplied by a\nconversion factor of 703. Weight status categories for children and\nadolescents shall be as defined by the commissioner of health.

Each certificate shall be\nsigned by a duly licensed dentist, or a registered dental hygienist who\nis authorized by law to practice in this state, and consistent with any\napplicable written practice agreement, or by a duly licensed dentist or\nregistered dental hygienist who is authorized to practice in the\njurisdiction in which the assessment was given, provided that the\ncommissioner has determined that such jurisdiction has standards of\nlicensure and practice comparable to those of New York. Each such\ncertificate shall describe the dental health condition of the student\nwhen the assessment was made, which shall not be more than twelve months\nprior to the commencement of the school year in which the assessment is\nrequested, and shall state whether such student is in fit condition of\ndental health to permit his or her attendance at the public schools.\n  b. A notice of request for dental health certificates shall be\ndistributed at the same time that parents or person in parental\nrelationship to students are notified of health examination requirements\nand shall state that a list of dental practices, dentists and registered\ndental hygienists to which children may be referred for dental services\non a free or reduced cost basis is available upon request at the child's\nschool. The department shall, in collaboration with the department of\nhealth, compile and maintain a list of dental practices, dentists and\nregistered dental hygienists to which children may be referred for\ndental services on a free or reduced cost basis. Such list shall be made\navailable to all public schools and be made available to parents or\nperson in parental relationship upon request. The department shall\npromulgate regulations to ensure the gathering and dissemination of the\nproper information to interested parties.\n  3. a. Within thirty days after the student's entrance in such schools\nor grades, the health certificate shall be submitted to the principal or\nhis or her designee and shall be filed in the student's cumulative\nhealth record.
