          <p>  § 520. Duties of employer. 1. Each employer shall keep such records\nand from time to time shall furnish such information as the retirement\nboard in the discharge of its duties may require.\n  2. a. Upon the employment of any teacher to whom this article may\napply, he shall be informed by his employer of his duties and\nobligations in connection with the retirement system as a condition of\nhis employment.  Every teacher accepting employment shall be deemed to\nconsent and agree to any deductions from his compensation required\nherein and to all other provisions of this article.\n  b. Upon the employment of any teacher whose right to membership in the\nsystem has been made optional by the retirement board pursuant to\nsubdivision two of section five hundred three of this article the\nemployer shall inform such teacher in writing of the right to join the\nsystem. Each such teacher shall acknowledge the receipt of such notice\nby signing a copy thereof and filing it with such employer. Provided,\nhowever, the failure to inform such teacher shall not in any way be\nconstrued to waive the requirement that membership for such a teacher\ncommences only when an application for membership is filed with the\nsystem nor shall it be construed to waive any of the eligibility\nrequirements for previous service credit.\n  3. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation affecting the\nsalary, pay, compensation, other prerequisites or tenure of any teacher\nto whom this article applies, or shall apply, and notwithstanding that\nthe minimum salary, pay, compensation or other prerequisites, provided\nby law for such teacher shall be reduced thereby, payment less said\ndeductions shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all\nclaims and demands whatsoever for service rendered by such member during\nthe period covered by such payment.\n  4. During September of each year, or at such other times as the\nretirement board shall approve, each employer shall certify to the\nretirement board the names of all teachers to whom this article applies.\n  5. Each employer shall on the first day of each calendar month or at\nsuch less frequent intervals as the retirement board may approve, notify\nthe retirement board of the employment of new teachers, removals,\nwithdrawals and changes in salary of members that shall have occurred\nduring the month preceding or the period covered since the last\nnotification.\n</p>
