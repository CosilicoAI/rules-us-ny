In a city of one\nmillion or more, a board of education may permit any teacher to apply\nfor and receive a leave of absence for a period not to exceed two years\nfor teaching in a college or university, certificated and accredited by\nthe commissioner of education, provided such college or university shall\nhave agreed to furnish an educator of professorial rank to fulfill the\nduties of the said teacher on leave of absence or any other duties\nassigned by the superintendent of schools. During the period of said\nleave of absence for teaching in a college or university, the said\nteacher shall receive from the school district in said city the same\ncompensation that he would have received had he been present and\nteaching in a school of the district and the college educator if he is a\nmember of a publicly operated college or system shall likewise receive\nthe same compensation as he would have received had he remained in the\ncollege or university. Such leave of absence shall not in any way affect\nthe retirement rights of the said teacher or college educator as a\nmember of a retirement system and the period of the aforesaid leave of\nabsence shall be credited to the total years of service of the said\nmember in the same manner and for all purposes as if he had continued in\nhis position. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter, nor\nany other local law or provision, the chancellor of the city board shall\nhave authority to issue to such college or university educator a special\ncertificate of competency which shall be valid for a period not to\nexceed two years and not renewable and under which such college or\nuniversity educator shall be permitted to fulfill the duties and\nassignments as herein provided.\n</p>
