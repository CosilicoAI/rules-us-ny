Such services shall not include diagnosing and/or\nperforming surgical procedures, irreversible procedures or procedures\nthat would alter the hard or soft tissue of the oral and maxillofacial\narea or any other procedures determined by the department. The practice\nof registered dental assisting may be conducted in the office of any\nlicensed dentist or in any appropriately equipped school or public\ninstitution but must be done under the direct personal supervision of a\nlicensed dentist. Direct personal supervision, for purposes of this\nsection, means supervision of dental procedures based on instructions\ngiven by a licensed dentist in the course of a procedure who remains in\nthe dental office where the supportive services are being performed,\npersonally diagnoses the condition to be treated, personally authorizes\nthe procedures, and before dismissal of the patient, who remains the\nresponsibility of the licensed dentist, evaluates the services performed\nby the registered dental assistant.

All\ndental supportive services provided in this section may be performed by\ncurrently registered dental hygienists either under a dentist's\nsupervision, as defined in regulations of the commissioner, or, in the\ncase of a registered dental hygienist working for a hospital as defined\nin article twenty-eight of the public health law, pursuant to a\ncollaborative arrangement with a licensed dentist in accordance with\nsubdivision one of section sixty-six hundred six of this article. Such\ncollaborative arrangement shall not obviate or supersede any law or\nregulation which requires identified services to be performed under the\npersonal supervision of a dentist.\n</p>
