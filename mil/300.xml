          <p>  § 300. Findings and declaration of emergency.  It has been nationally\nrecognized that because of the emergent conditions which are threatening\nthe peace and imperiling the security of the nation, there is imperative\nneed to augment and strengthen the national defense.  It is further\nrecognized that the emergent conditions which endanger the national\nwell-being likewise constitute an imminent threat and hazard to the\npeace and security of the people of the state.  Moreover, it is\nacknowledged that the exigencies of national defense require that the\npeople of the state, in large numbers, be called into military service,\nand as a consequence, the health, prosperity and welfare of all of the\npeople of the state is inevitably affected.\n  In these circumstances, and in order to promote and to assist the\nnational defense, and thereby to protect the peace, prosperity and\nhealth of the people of the state, it is necessary that citizens and\nresidents of the state in the military service as well as those who are\nmembers of the organized militia or of a reserve component of the armed\nforces of the United States should be free to devote their entire energy\nand effort to the defense needs of the nation and of the state.  To\nassist in this end, it is essential to provide in certain cases for the\ntemporary suspension of legal proceedings and transactions which may\nprejudice the civil rights of persons in the military service.  It is\nfurther essential in the interests of the prosperity and well-being of\nthe people of the state, that such persons, upon completion of military\nservice, be restored to their former employment.\n  The legislature finds, further, that citizens and residents of the\nstate, not in military service, who are members of the organized militia\nor of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States are\nbeing discriminated against by certain employers who either refuse to\nemploy them because of such membership or, if employed, discharge or\notherwise discriminate against them because of such membership and that\nsuch acts of discrimination jeopardize the recruiting of citizens and\nresidents of the state into the organized militia and the reserve\ncomponents of the armed forces of the United States and otherwise affect\nthe security of the state.\n  The legislature finds, further, that citizens and residents of the\nstate, not in military service and not members of the organized militia\nor of the reserve components of the armed forces of the United States,\nare discriminated against by certain employers who refuse to employ them\nbecause they are subject to military service in the armed forces of the\nUnited States under the selective service act of nineteen hundred\nforty-eight, as amended.\n  In the interpretation and application of this article, it is hereby\ndeclared to be the public policy of the state to maintain, secure and\nprotect the civil and property rights of persons in the military\nservice, as hereinafter defined, and of employees who are members of the\norganized militia or members of a reserve component of the armed forces\nof the United States.\n  The legislature hereby declares the existence of a public emergency\naffecting the health, safety and comfort of the people, requiring the\nenactment of the provisions of this act to protect the vital interests\nof the state.\n  All the provisions of this article shall be liberally construed for\nthe accomplishment of this purpose.\n  This article shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the\nstate, for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health and\npeace of the people of the state.\n</p>
