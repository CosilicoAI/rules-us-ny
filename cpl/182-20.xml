            <p>of subdivision one of this section and the\nproceeding has commenced but the electronic appearance is subsequently\nterminated and the proceeding is adjourned pursuant to subdivision four\nor five of this section, such initial consent shall continue to govern\nthat proceeding, provided that such consent shall not modify the\nrequirement that the court terminate an electronic appearance and\nadjourn a proceeding for the reasons outlined in such subdivisions four\nand five of this section.\n  3. Any proceeding under this article shall provide an appropriate\nopportunity for any defense attorney to confidentially consult with\ntheir client or for a pro se defendant to confidentially consult with\ntheir legal advisor, if any, during the proceeding.\n  4.

If a statute other than this article provides different rules for\nconducting an electronic appearance for any particular kind of\nproceeding, such other statute shall govern such proceeding and the\nprovisions of this article shall apply only to the extent this article\nis not inconsistent with such other statute.\n  * NB Repealed September 1, 2028\n</p>
