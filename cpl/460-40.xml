The taking of an appeal by the people to an intermediate appellate\ncourt pursuant to subdivision one-a of section 450.20, from an order\nreducing a count or counts of an indictment or dismissing an indictment\nand directing the filing of a prosecutor's information, stays the effect\nof such order.  In addition, the taking of an appeal by the people to an\nintermediate appellate court pursuant to subdivision one of section\n450.20, from an order dismissing a count or counts of an indictment\ncharging murder in the first degree, stays the effect of such order.\n  3.

The rules shall provide\nthat in the event a defendant seeks to file any subsequent motion with\nrespect to the judgment or sentence following a final determination of\nthe defendant's initial motion pursuant to section 440.10 or 440.20, a\nmotion for a stay of the execution of the death warrant may only be\ngranted for good cause shown. The people and the defendant shall have a\nright to appeal to the court of appeals from orders granting or denying\nsuch stay motions and any rules adopted pursuant to this subdivision\nshall provide that the court of appeals may affirm such orders, reverse\nthem or modify them upon such terms as the court deems appropriate and\nshall provide for the expeditious perfection and determination of such\nappeals.
