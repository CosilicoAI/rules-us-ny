            <p>must dismiss the indictment filed in\nsuch court against the defendant, and such dismissal constitutes a bar\nto any further prosecution of the charge or charges contained in such\nindictment. Upon the issuance of a final order of observation, the\ndistrict attorney shall immediately transmit to the commissioner, in a\nmanner intended to protect the confidentiality of the information, a\nlist of names and contact information of persons who may reasonably be\nexpected to be the victim of any assault or any violent felony offense,\nas defined in the penal law, or any offense listed in section 530.11 of\nthis chapter which would be carried out by the committed person;\nprovided that the person who reasonably may be expected to be a victim\ndoes not need to be a member of the same family or household as the\ncommitted person. When the indictment charges a felony or when the\ndefendant has been convicted of a felony, it must issue an order of\ncommitment committing the defendant to the custody of the commissioner\nfor care and treatment in an appropriate institution or, upon the\nconsent of the district attorney, committing him or her to the custody\nof the commissioner for care and treatment on an out-patient basis, for\na period not to exceed one year from the date of such order. Upon the\nissuance of an order of commitment, the court must exonerate the\ndefendant's bail if he or she was previously at liberty on bail;\nprovided, however, that exoneration of bail is not required when a\ndefendant is committed to the custody of the commissioner for care and\ntreatment on an out-patient basis. When the defendant is in the custody\nof the commissioner pursuant to a final order of observation, the\ncommissioner or his or her designee, which may include the director of\nan appropriate institution, immediately upon the discharge of the\ndefendant, must certify to such court that he or she has complied with\nthe notice provisions set forth in paragraph</p>

            <p>of subdivision six of\nsection 730.60 of this article.\n  2. When a defendant is in the custody of the commissioner immediately\nprior to the expiration of the period prescribed in a temporary order of\ncommitment and the superintendent of the institution wherein the\ndefendant is confined is of the opinion that the defendant continues to\nbe an incapacitated person, such superintendent must apply to the court\nthat issued such order for an order of retention. Such application must\nbe made within sixty days prior to the expiration of such period on\nforms that have been jointly adopted by the judicial conference and the\ncommissioner. The superintendent must give written notice of the\napplication to the defendant and to the mental hygiene legal service.\nUpon receipt of such application, the court may, on its own motion,\nconduct a hearing to determine the issue of capacity, and it must\nconduct such hearing if a demand therefor is made by the defendant or\nthe mental hygiene legal service within ten days from the date that\nnotice of the application was given them. If, at the conclusion of a\nhearing conducted pursuant to this subdivision, the court is satisfied\nthat the defendant is no longer an incapacitated person, the criminal\naction against him must proceed. If it is satisfied that the defendant\ncontinues to be an incapacitated person, or if no demand for a hearing\nis made, the court must adjudicate him an incapacitated person and must\nissue an order of retention which shall authorize continued custody of\nthe defendant by the commissioner for a period not to exceed one year.\n  3. When a defendant is in the custody of the commissioner immediately\nprior to the expiration of the period prescribed in the first order of\nretention, the procedure set forth in subdivision two shall govern the\napplication for and the issuance of any subsequent order of retention,\nexcept that any subsequent orders of retention must be for periods not\nto exceed two years ea...</p>
