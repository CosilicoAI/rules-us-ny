If the court is of the opinion, based upon the specific factors set\nforth in the district attorney's memorandum, that the interests of\njustice would best be served by removal of the action to the family\ncourt, the verdict shall be set aside and a plea of guilty of a crime or\nact for which the defendant is not criminally responsible may be entered\npursuant to subdivision three or four of section 220.10 of this chapter.\nUpon accepting any such plea, the court must specify upon the record the\nportion or portions of the district attorney's statement the court is\nrelying upon as the basis of its opinion and that it believes the\ninterests of justice would best be served by removal of the proceeding\nto the family court. Such plea shall then be deemed to be a juvenile\ndelinquency fact determination and the court upon entry thereof must\ndirect that the action be removed to the family court in accordance with\nthe provisions of article seven hundred twenty-five of this chapter.\n</p>
