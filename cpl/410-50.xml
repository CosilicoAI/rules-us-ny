          <p>§ 410.50  Custody and supervision of probationers.\n  1.  Custody.  A person who is under a sentence of probation is in the\nlegal custody of the court that imposed it pending expiration or\ntermination of the period of the sentence.\n  2.  Supervision.  The probation department serving the court that\nimposed a sentence of probation has the duty of supervising the\ndefendant during the period of such legal custody.\n  3.  Search order.  If at any time during the period of probation the\ncourt has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has violated a\ncondition of the sentence, it may issue a search order.  Such order must\nbe directed to a probation officer and may authorize such officer to\nsearch the person of the defendant and/or any premises in which he\nresides or any real or personal property which he owns or which is in\nhis possession.\n  4.  Taking custody without warrant.  When a probation officer has\nreasonable cause to believe that a person under his supervision pursuant\nto a sentence of probation has violated a condition of the sentence,\nsuch officer may, without a warrant, take the probationer into custody\nand search his person.\n  5.  Assistance by police officer.  In executing a search order, or in\ntaking a person into custody, pursuant to this section, a probation\nofficer may be assisted by a police officer.\n</p>
