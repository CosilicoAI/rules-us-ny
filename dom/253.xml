Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to require any party to consult with any clergyman or minister\nto determine whether there exists any such religious or conscientious\nrestraint or inhibition. It shall not be deemed a "barrier to\nremarriage" within the meaning of this section if the restraint or\ninhibition cannot be removed by the party's voluntary act.
