        <content>
          <p>  § 13-b. Time within which marriage may be solemnized. A marriage shall\nnot be solemnized within twenty-four hours after the issuance of the\nmarriage license, unless authorized by an order of a court of record as\nhereinafter provided, nor shall it be solemnized after sixty days from\nthe date of the issuance of the marriage license unless authorized\npursuant to section ten of the veterans' services law.  Every license to\nmarry hereafter issued by a town or city clerk, in addition to other\nrequirements specified by this chapter, must contain a statement of the\nday and the hour the license is issued and the period during which the\nmarriage may be solemnized. It shall be the duty of the clergyman,\nmagistrate, or one-day marriage officiant, as designated by a town or\ncity clerk pursuant to section eleven-d of this article, performing the\nmarriage ceremony, or if the marriage is solemnized by written contract,\nof the judge before whom the contract is acknowledged, to annex to or\nendorse upon the marriage license the date and hour the marriage is\nsolemnized. A judge or justice of the supreme court of this state or the\ncounty judge of the county in which either party to be married resides,\nor the judge of the family court of such county, if it shall appear from\nan examination of the license and any other proofs submitted by the\nparties that one of the parties is in danger of imminent death, or by\nreason of other emergency public interest will be promoted thereby, or\nthat such delay will work irreparable injury or great hardship upon the\ncontracting parties, or one of them, may, make an order authorizing the\nimmediate solemnization of the marriage and upon filing such order with\nthe clergyman, magistrate, or one-day marriage officiant performing the\nmarriage ceremony, or if the marriage is to be solemnized by written\ncontract, with the judge before whom the contract is acknowledged, such\nclergyman, magistrate or such one-day marriage officiant may solemnize\nsuch marriage, or such judge may take such acknowledgment as the case\nmay be, without waiting for such three day period and twenty-four hour\nperiod to elapse. The clergyman, magistrate, judge, or such one-day\nmarriage officiant, as designated by a town or city clerk pursuant to\nsection eleven-d of this article, must file such order with the town or\ncity clerk who issued the license within five days after the marriage is\nsolemnized. Such town or city clerk must record and index the order in\nthe book required to be kept by him or her for recording affidavits,\nstatements, consents and licenses, and when so recorded the order shall\nbecome a public record and available in any prosecution under this\nsection. A person who shall solemnize a marriage in violation of this\nsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof\nshall be punished by a fine of fifty dollars for each offense, and in\naddition thereto, his or her right to solemnize a marriage shall be\nsuspended for ninety days.\n</p>
