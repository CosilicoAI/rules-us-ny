In the event of the loss, mutilation or destruction of any\ncertificate of registration, the owner of the registered ATV may file\nsuch statement and proof of the facts as the commissioner shall require\nwith a fee of three dollars, with the department, for the issuance of a\nduplicate or substitute.\n  2. Carrying certificate. Every person operating an ATV registered in\naccordance with any of the provisions of this article shall, upon demand\nof any magistrate, police officer or peace officer, when acting pursuant\nto his special duties, produce for inspection the certificate of\nregistration for such ATV and shall furnish to such person any\ninformation necessary for the identification of such ATV and its owner.\nThe failure to produce the certificate of registration as provided\nherein shall not be an offense, but shall be presumptive evidence of\noperating an ATV which is not registered as required by this article.\n  3. Change of residence. It shall be the duty of every owner holding a\ncertificate of registration to notify the department, in writing, of any\nchange of residence of such owner within ten days after such change\noccurs, and to inscribe on such certificate, in the place provided a\nrecord of such change of residence.\n  4.

Such application shall be submitted to the department\ntogether with old certificate of registration, properly signed by the\nprevious owner, and the required fee of ten dollars. The old certificate\nof registration, properly signed by the previous owner or other indicia\nas prescribed by regulation of the commissioner, shall constitute a\ntemporary registration for such new owner for a period determined by the\ncommissioner from the date such ATV was transferred to the new owner. In\nthe event that such ATV was purchased from a registered dealer, the\napplication must be accompanied by the old certificate of registration\ntransferred to the dealer, the required fee, and by any other forms or\ndocuments completed and submitted as prescribed by the commissioner.\n  5.
