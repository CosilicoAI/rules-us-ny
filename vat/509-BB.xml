Every required\nroad test shall be administered on an appropriate vehicle defined as a\nbus pursuant to section five hundred nine-a of this article.\n  (3) For purposes of this section, one such accident shall not be\ncounted if the person successfully completes a motor vehicle accident\nprevention course approved by the commissioner.\n  (4) Upon the failure of the licensee to successfully complete a\nreexamination authorized by this section, the commissioner shall take\nsuch reasonable action as may be required. Such action may consist of\nimposing restrictions on the use of the license of such person,\nsuspending such license for a definite or indefinite period, or revoking\nsuch license. The commissioner may revoke or suspend for an indefinite\nperiod the license of any person who after reasonable notice fails or\nrefuses to submit to such reexamination. No person whose license has\nbeen suspended or revoked under this section shall be qualified to\noperate a bus until such person successfully completes a reexamination\nauthorized by this section.\n  (5) Upon a driver's successful completion of a reexamination required\nby this section, the commissioner shall issue an eighteen-month\nprobationary license to such driver and all of the provisions of section\nfive hundred ten-b of this article shall apply.\n</p>
