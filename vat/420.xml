          <p>  § 420. Transfer of registration. 1. Upon the transfer of ownership or\nthe destruction of a motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer, its\nregistration shall expire; and the seller, or the owner in case of\ndestruction, shall remove the number plates from the vehicle.\n  2. Such seller or owner may, however, register another vehicle and use\nsaid number plates thereon, if appropriate, upon making application for\nsuch registration, paying a transfer fee of ten dollars, and paying the\nproportional excess, if any, of the annual fee for registering the\nsecond vehicle over the annual fee for registering the first vehicle for\neach day or fraction thereof constituting the unexpired registration\nperiod. If the number plates of the first vehicle are not appropriate\nfor the second vehicle, the commissioner or his or her agent shall, upon\nthe surrender of such number plates, furnish appropriate number plates.\n  3. Provided, however, that upon the death of an owner of a registered\nmotor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer, its registration shall, unless the\nvehicle is destroyed, be deemed to continue in force as a valid\nregistration until the end of the year or until the ownership of such\nvehicle is transferred by the executor or administrator of the estate of\nsuch owner or by the distributees of his personal property, whichever\noccurs first. If the ownership of such vehicle is transferred as exempt\nproperty under section 5-3.1 of the estates, powers and trusts law to\nthe surviving spouse of the owner, the fee for the initial registration\nissued to such surviving spouse shall be the fee for such registration\nreduced by the amount of the fee remaining for the unexpired term of the\nregistration issued to the deceased.\n  4. Provided, further, that upon the permanent removal of a vehicle\nfrom the state, the owner may remove the number plates and be entitled\nto the same privileges as though the vehicle had been sold or destroyed.\n  5. Provided, further, that a holder of manufacturers' and dealers'\nregistration having a motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer registered in\nhis or its name under the provisions of this chapter may, if such\nvehicle is placed in stock for sale, also remove the number plates and\nbe entitled to the same privileges as though the vehicle had been sold\nor destroyed.\n  6. Provided, further, that the registration of a vehicle registered in\nthe names of two or more persons, as partners or otherwise, shall not\nexpire upon a change in ownership of the vehicle so long as any of the\npersons named in such registration as owners of the vehicle is the owner\nor part owner of the vehicle. However, when any change in the ownership\nof such a vehicle occurs and the registration does not expire, the owner\nor owners after such change shall forthwith file with the commissioner a\nstatement of the ownership of such vehicle in such form as the\ncommissioner shall require, together with a fee of ten dollars, and the\ncommissioner shall issue a new certificate of registration.\n  7. Where a dealer having registration under the provisions of section\nfour hundred fifteen of this chapter sells or trades a vehicle to a\nperson who has another vehicle duly registered under this chapter, or\nwho had another vehicle previously so registered, and the registration\nof such vehicle is eligible for transfer to the purchased vehicle under\nthe provisions of this section and the number plates of the first\nvehicle are appropriate, such dealer may issue on any date on which the\nregistration of a motor vehicle may be used a temporary certificate of\nregistration of the second vehicle under which such vehicle may be\noperated as a duly registered vehicle for a period of thirty days from\nthe date of issuance, other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding.\nSuch temporary certificate of registration may be extended by the\ncommissioner for an additional thirty days, except that in no event\nshall any such temporary certificate of registration be valid after the\nexpiration date of the registration for the first vehicle. Such\ncertificate shall be issued upon a form furnished by the commissioner\nand shall be executed in such manner as he shall prescribe.\n  8. The owner of a registered motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer may\ntransfer the registration and, if appropriate, the number plates thereof\nto another vehicle owned by him or her upon making application for such\ntransfer, paying a transfer fee of ten dollars, and paying the\nproportionate excess, if any, of the annual fee for registering the\nsecond vehicle over the annual fee for registering the first vehicle for\neach day or fraction thereof constituting the unexpired registration\nperiod, provided, however, that the registration and number plates for\nthe second vehicle, if such vehicle is registered in this state, are\neither surrendered to the commissioner or transferred to another vehicle\nas provided herein. If the number plates of the first vehicle are not\nappropriate for the second vehicle, the commissioner or his or her agent\nshall, upon the surrender of such number plates, furnish appropriate\nnumber plates. Whenever a total fee for reregistration prescribed in\nthis section shall amount to a fee other than a whole dollar amount, the\nfee required to be paid shall be rounded to the nearest twenty-five\ncents.\n</p>
