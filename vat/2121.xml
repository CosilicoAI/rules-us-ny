Payment sufficient to satisfy\nthe security interest by an insurer of the owner shall be deemed an\nauthorization by the owner for the delivery of the release of the\nsecurity interest to the insurer. If the payment in satisfaction of the\nsecurity interest is in cash, certified check, intra-bank transfer of\nfunds or an uncertified check or draft issued by an insurance company\nauthorized to do business in this state, the payment shall be deemed to\nbe cleared immediately upon receipt. The owner, other than a dealer\nholding the vehicle for resale, may cause the certificate and release to\nbe mailed or delivered to the commissioner, who shall release the\nlienholder's rights on the certificate or issue a new certificate.\n</p>

The commissioner is\nauthorized to adopt and enforce reasonable rules and regulations\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision.\n</p>
