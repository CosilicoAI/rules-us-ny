            <p>make a biennial report to the commissioner,\nwhich shall be due on the first day of April every second year following\nimplementation of the program and shall include an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the program, recommendations for expanding and\nimproving the program and any problems or other matters related to the\nadministration of the program. Such report shall also be made available\nto the temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the\nassembly.\n  4. Every county and the city of New York that establishes a\nhandicapped parking education program shall establish a separate\nhandicapped parking education fund in the custody of the chief fiscal\nofficer of each such county or city, by April first, two thousand, which\nshall consist of moneys granted to such county or city pursuant to\nsection eighteen hundred nine-b of this chapter. No provision of law\nshall be deemed to preclude a county or the city of New York from\nreceiving funds from other sources to be deposited in the handicapped\nparking education fund, provided such funds are used in a manner and for\npurposes consistent with this section. The moneys of such fund shall be\ndisbursed to provide education, advocacy and increased awareness of\nhandicapped parking laws and may be used to execute contracts with\nprivate organizations for such purposes. Such contracts shall be awarded\nupon competitive bids after the issuance of requests for proposal.\n</p>
