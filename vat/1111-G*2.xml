            <p>1. Notwithstanding any other provision\nof law, the county of Westchester is hereby authorized and empowered to\nadopt and amend a local law or ordinance establishing a demonstration\nprogram imposing monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for\nfailure of an operator thereof to comply with traffic-control\nindications in such county in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection. Such demonstration program shall empower such county to install\nand operate traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices at\nno more than fifty intersections within and under the jurisdiction of\nsuch county at any one time. Provided that, in addition to the fifty\nintersections within and under its jurisdiction, such county may install\nand operate traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices at\nno more than one intersection located on the portion of the Saw Mill\nRiver parkway within the village of Pleasantville, county of\nWestchester, upon approval in writing obtained by such county from the\ndepartment of transportation, provided that the department of\ntransportation may at any time rescind or modify such approval.\n  2. Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to\nensure, to the extent practicable, that photographs produced by such\ntraffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring systems shall not\ninclude images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents\nof the vehicle. Provided, however, that no notice of liability issued\npursuant to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph\nor photographs allow for the identification of the contents of a\nvehicle, provided that such county has made a reasonable effort to\ncomply with the provisions of this paragraph.\n</p>
