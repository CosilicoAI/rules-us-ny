            <p>Within the first ten days of the month next succeeding the\ncollection of such surcharge, the collecting authority in cities having\na population of one hundred thousand or more but less than one million\nshall pay such surcharge to the chief fiscal officer of the municipality\nand such surcharge shall be used by the municipality from which it\noriginated for its local criminal justice programs and purposes.\n  3. Any person who has paid a mandatory surcharge under the authority\nof this section which is ultimately determined not to be required by\nthis section shall be entitled to a refund of such mandatory surcharge\nupon written application to the collecting authority. The collecting\nauthority shall require such proof as is necessary in order to determine\nwhether a refund is required by law. If the collecting authority shall\nrefund any portion of the surcharge previously paid to the justice court\nfund pursuant to subdivision two of this section, the collecting\nauthority may offset an equal amount from a subsequent remittance to the\njustice court fund, provided, however, that the collecting authority\nshall prepare such reports and provide such information with respect to\nsuch refunds as the comptroller shall direct, and provided, further,\nthat the comptroller, upon review of such reports and information, may\ndirect that any appropriate adjustments be made in future payments to\nthe justice court fund pursuant to subdivision two of this section.\n  4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where a\nmandatory surcharge is imposed pursuant to the provisions of section\n60.35 of the penal law or section eighteen hundred nine or eighteen\nhundred nine-b of this article, no mandatory surcharge shall be imposed\npursuant to the provisions of this section.\n  * NB Repealed September 1, 2027\n</p>
