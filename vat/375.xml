A motor carrier may seek review of the determination to\nassign imputed mileage as provided pursuant to article six of the\ntransportation law and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n  (ii) The imputed mileage shall be calculated by adding the mileage of\nthe stretch limousine recorded at the two most recent stretch limousine\ninspections, including roadside inspections conducted by the\ncommissioner of transportation or division of state police, whichever is\nmore recent, and dividing that sum by twenty-four. The quotient is the\nimputed monthly mileage.\n  (iii) Unless otherwise provided by the commissioner of transportation,\na stretch limousine may not be operated or caused to be operated to\ntransport passengers for compensation or continue transporting\npassengers for compensation if a reliable baseline odometer reading\ncannot be ascertained.\n  (iv) A motor carrier or operator who knows or has reason to believe\nthat the odometer reading of a limousine differs from the number of\nmiles the stretch limousine has actually traveled shall disclose that\nstatus to the commissioner or the department of transportation\nimmediately.\n  * NB Effective April 20, 2026\n</p>
