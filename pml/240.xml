All such annual financial statements and yearly audits shall be\nsubject to audit by the state comptroller and shall be public records.\n  2. The franchised corporation shall require the independent certified\npublic accountant to render the following additional reports:\n  a. a report on material weakness in accounting, internal controls, and\nbusiness and management practices discovered in the ordinary course of\npreparing such audited financial statements.

Whenever in the opinion of the independent certified\npublic accountant the franchised corporation has deviated from the\nsystem of accounting and internal controls filed with the franchise\noversight board or the accounts, records, and control procedures\nexamined are not maintained by the franchised corporation in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting standards the report shall enumerate\nsuch deviations. The independent certified public accountant shall also\nreport on areas of the system no longer considered effective, and shall\nmake recommendations in writing regarding improvements in the system of\naccounting and internal controls.\n  3.

The disagreements to be reported include those resolved\nand those not resolved; and\n  c. whether the former accountant's report on the financial statements\nfor any of the past two years contained an adverse opinion or disclaimer\nof opinion or was qualified.
