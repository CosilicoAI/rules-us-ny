            <p>Any\nassociation or corporation licensed to conduct harness race meetings at\nwhich pari-mutuel betting is permitted may, if in its sole discretion\nsuch association or corporation determines that it would be beneficial,\noffer non-stakes races that are limited to New York-bred horses or\nhorses wholly owned by New York state residents. These races may be\nwritten on such terms and conditions as any other race authorized\npursuant to law or regulation of the commission, notwithstanding any\npreference date requirements.\n</p>

            <p>For each horse entered into a race that is limited to horses\nwholly owned by New York state residents, each owner shall provide\ndocumentation that demonstrates that such horse is wholly owned by a New\nYork state resident.

In the\ncase of a horse owned by a corporation, all owners, officers,\nshareholders, and directors shall meet the requirements of a New York\nstate resident; in the case of a horse owned by an association, all\nowners shall meet the requirements of a New York state resident.\n</p>
