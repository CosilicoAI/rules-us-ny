The commission may\ncontinue such hearing from time to time for the convenience of all\nparties. Any of the parties affected by such hearing may be represented\nby counsel, and the commission may be represented by the attorney\ngeneral or an assistant attorney general. In the conduct of such hearing\nthe commission shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence, but\nall evidence offered before the commission shall be reduced to writing,\nand such evidence together with the exhibits, if any, and the findings\nof the commission, shall be permanently preserved and shall constitute\nthe record of the commission in such case. In connection with such\nhearing, each member of the commission shall have the power to\nadminister oaths and examine witnesses, and may issue subpoenas to\ncompel the attendance of witnesses, and the production of all necessary\nreports, books, papers, documents, correspondence and other evidence.\nThe commission may, if occasion shall require, by order, refer to one or\nmore of its members, the duty of taking testimony in such matter, and to\nreport thereon to the commission, but no determination shall be made\ntherein except by the commission. Within thirty days after such hearing,\nthe commission shall make a final determination. If the commission\ndetermines that such license shall not be granted, or that a license\nissued by the commission shall be revoked, or a franchise revoked\npursuant to sections two hundred twelve and two hundred forty-four of\nthis article, the commission shall make an order accordingly, and shall\ncause such order to be entered on the commission's minutes and a copy\nthereof served on such applicant, licensee or franchised corporation, as\nthe case may be.  The action of the commission in refusing to grant a\nlicense, or in revoking a license, or in revoking a franchise pursuant\nto sections two hundred twelve and two hundred forty-four of this\narticle, shall be reviewable in the supreme court in the manner provided\nby the provisions of article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and\nrules.\n</p>
