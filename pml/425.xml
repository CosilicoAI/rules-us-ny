Notwithstanding any such\nagreement, no such association or corporation shall discharge any\nemployee for non-membership in a labor union or labor organization if it\nhas reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not\navailable to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally\napplicable to other members, or if it has reasonable grounds for\nbelieving that membership was denied or terminated for any reason other\nthan the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the\ninitiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or\nretaining membership.\n  2.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to employees engaged\nin the preparation, service and handling of food and beverages in the\noperation of a restaurant or a food or beverage dispensing facility at\nsuch track.\n</p>
