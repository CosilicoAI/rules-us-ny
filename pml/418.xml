"Exotic bet" or "exotic wager" shall mean a single bet or\nwager on three or more horses, evidenced by a single ticket and\nrepresenting an interest in a single betting pool. The breaks for\nregular bets and multiple bets are hereby defined as the odd cents over\nany multiple of ten or for exotic bets, over any multiple of fifty\ncalculated on the basis of one dollar and otherwise payable to a patron.\nOf the sum so retained the applicable tax rates for regular bets shall\nbe three percent; the applicable tax rates for multiple bets shall be\nthree and one-half percent; the applicable tax rates for exotic bets\nshall be eight percent, plus sixty-five percent of the amount of the\nbreaks from on-track regular, multiple and exotic bets shall be paid by\nsuch corporation or association to the department of taxation and\nfinance as a reasonable tax by the state for the privilege of conducting\npari-mutuel betting on the races run at the quarter horse race meetings\nheld by such corporation or association, which tax is hereby levied, and\nthe balance of the retained percentage of such pool and of the breaks\nmay be held by such corporation or association for its own use and\npurposes. The payment of such state tax shall be made to the department\nof taxation and finance at such regular intervals as the department of\ntaxation and finance may require, and shall be accompanied by a report\nunder oath showing the total of all such contributions together with\nsuch other information as the department of taxation and finance may\nrequire.
