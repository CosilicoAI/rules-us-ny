The commission shall prescribe rules and regulations for\neffectually preventing the use of improper devices, the administration\nof drugs or stimulants or other improper acts for the purpose of\naffecting the speed of quarter horses in any race in which they are\nabout to participate.\n  c. The rules of the commission shall also provide that all winning\npari-mutuel tickets must be presented for payment before April first of\nthe year following the year of their purchase and failure to present any\nsuch ticket within the prescribed period of time shall constitute a\nwaiver of the right to participate in the award or dividend.\n  d. The commission shall have power in its discretion, consistent with\nthe powers of the department of taxation and finance, to prescribe\nuniform methods of keeping accounts, records and books to be observed by\nassociations or corporations licensed under the provisions of this\narticle or by any association or corporation that owns stock in, or\nshares in the profits, or participates in the management or affairs of,\nsuch licensed association or corporation, or by any person, firm,\nassociation or corporation holding any concession, right or privilege to\nperform any service or sell any article at any track at which\npari-mutuel quarter horse racing meets are conducted.
