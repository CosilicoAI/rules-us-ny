            <p>of this\nsubdivision shall be effective so long as a franchised corporation\nnotifies the commission by August fifteenth of each year that such\npari-mutuel tax rate is effective of its intent to conduct a race\nmeeting at Aqueduct racetrack during the months of December, January,\nFebruary, March and April. For purposes of this paragraph such race\nmeeting shall consist of not less than ninety-five days of racing unless\notherwise agreed to in writing by the New York Thoroughbred Breeders\nInc., the New York thoroughbred horsemen's association (or such other\nentity as is certified and approved pursuant to section two hundred\ntwenty-eight of this article) and approved by the commission. Not later\nthan May first of each year that such pari-mutuel tax rate is effective,\nthe commission shall determine whether a race meeting at Aqueduct\nracetrack consisted of the number of days as required by this paragraph.\nIn determining the number of race days, cancellation of a race day\nbecause of an act of God that the commission approves or because of\nweather conditions that are unsafe or hazardous that the commission\napproves shall not be construed as a failure to conduct a race day.\nAdditionally, cancellation of a race day because of circumstances beyond\nthe control of such franchised corporation for which the commission\ngives approval shall not be construed as a failure to conduct a race\nday. If the commission determines that the number of days of racing as\nrequired by this paragraph have not occurred then the pari-mutuel tax\nrate in paragraph</p>

            <p>of this subdivision shall revert to the\npari-mutuel tax rates in effect prior to January first, nineteen hundred\nninety-five.\n  (ii) Such franchised corporation shall pay to the commission as a\nregulatory fee, which fee is hereby levied, six-tenths of one percent of\nthe total daily on-track pari-mutuel pools of such franchised\ncorporation.\n  2. a. Subject to the provisions of this section the payment of such\nstate tax shall be made to the commissioner of taxation and finance on\nthe last business day of each month and shall cover taxes due for the\nperiod from the sixteenth day of the preceding month through the\nfifteenth day of the current month provided, however, that such payments\nrequired to be made on March thirty-first shall include all taxes due\nand accruing through the last full week of racing in March of the\ncurrent year or as otherwise determined by the commissioner, and shall\nbe accompanied by a report under oath, showing such information as the\ncommissioner may require. A penalty of five per centum and interest at\nthe rate of one per centum per month from the date the report is\nrequired to be filed to the date of the payment of the tax shall be\npayable in case any tax imposed by this section is not paid when due. If\nthe commissioner determines that any moneys received by the commissioner\nunder this section were paid in error, the commissioner may cause the\nsame to be refunded without interest out of any moneys collected\nthereunder, provided an application therefor is filed with the\ncommissioner within one year from the time the erroneous payment was\nmade. Such taxes, interest and penalties when collected, after the\ndeduction of refunds of taxes erroneously paid, shall be paid by the\ncommissioner into the general fund of the state treasury.\n  b.
