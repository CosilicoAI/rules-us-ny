While gambling already exists throughout the state, the state does\nnot fully capitalize on the economic development potential of legalized\ngambling;\n  4. The state should authorize four destination resort casinos in\nupstate New York;\n  5. Four upstate casinos can boost economic development, create\nthousands of well-paying jobs and provide added revenue to the state;\n  6. The upstate tourism industry constitutes a critical component of\nour state's economic infrastructure and that four upstate casinos will\nattract non-New York residents and bring downstate New Yorkers to\nupstate;\n  7. The casino sites and the licensed owners shall be selected on\nmerit;\n  8. Local impact of the casino sites will be considered in the casino\nevaluation process;\n  9. Revenue realized from casinos shall be utilized to increase support\nfor education beyond that of the state's education formulae and to\nprovide real property tax relief to localities;\n  10. Casinos will be tightly and strictly regulated by the commission\nto guarantee public confidence and trust in the credibility and\nintegrity of all casino gambling in the state and to prevent organized\ncrime from any involvement in the casino industry;\n  11. The need for strict state controls extends to regulation of all\npersons, locations, practices and associations related to the operation\nof licensed enterprises and all related service industries as provided\nin this article;\n  12. The state and the casinos will develop programs and resources to\ncombat compulsive and problem gambling;\n  13.
