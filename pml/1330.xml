Each labor\norganization, union or affiliate seeking to represent employees who are\nemployed in a gaming facility by a gaming facility licensee shall\nregister with the commission biennially, and shall disclose such\ninformation as the commission may require, including the names of all\naffiliated organizations, pension and welfare systems and all officers\nand agents of such organizations and systems; provided, however, that no\nlabor organization, union, or affiliate shall be required to furnish\nsuch information to the extent such information is included in a report\nfiled by any labor organization, union, or affiliate with the Secretary\nof Labor pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 431 et seq. or § 1001 et seq. if a copy\nof such report, or of the portion thereof containing such information,\nis furnished to the commission pursuant to the aforesaid federal\nprovisions. The commission may in its discretion exempt any labor\norganization, union, or affiliate from the registration requirements of\nthis subdivision where the commission finds that such organization,\nunion or affiliate is not the certified bargaining representative of any\nemployee who is employed in a gaming facility by a gaming facility\nlicensee, is not involved actively, directly or substantially in the\ncontrol or direction of the representation of any such employee, and is\nnot seeking to do so.\n  2. No person may act as an officer, agent or principal employee of a\nlabor organization, union or affiliate registered or required to be\nregistered pursuant to this section if the person has been found\ndisqualified by the commission in accordance with the criteria contained\nin section one thousand three hundred eighteen of this article. The\ncommission may, for purposes of this subdivision, waive any\ndisqualification criterion consistent with the public policy of this\narticle and upon a finding that the interests of justice so require.\n  3. Neither a labor organization, union or affiliate nor its officers\nand agents not otherwise individually licensed or registered under this\narticle and employed by a gaming facility licensee may hold any\nfinancial interest whatsoever in the gaming facility or gaming facility\nlicensee whose employees they represent.\n  4. The commission may maintain a civil action and proceed in a summary\nmanner, without posting bond, against any person, including any labor\norganization, union or affiliate, to compel compliance with this\nsection, or to prevent any violations, the aiding and abetting thereof,\nor any attempt or conspiracy to violate this section.\n  5. In addition to any other remedies provided in this section, a labor\norganization, union or affiliate registered or required to be registered\npursuant to this section may be prohibited by the commission from\nreceiving any dues from any employee licensed or registered under this\narticle and employed by a gaming facility licensee or its agent, if any\nofficer, agent or principal employee of the labor organization, union or\naffiliate has been found disqualified and if such disqualification has\nnot been waived by the commission in accordance with subdivision two of\nthis section.\n</p>
