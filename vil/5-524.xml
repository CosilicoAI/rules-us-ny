The term "claim", as used in\nthis section, shall include all bills, accounts and demands for the\npayment of money, of whatever nature, asserted against the village.\n  2. In a village which has not established the office of auditor, the\nboard of trustees shall audit all claims against the village, except\nthat it may, by resolution, authorize and empower a separate board of\ncommissioners, a board possessing the powers of two or more such boards\nor another board possessing like powers to audit and order paid all\nclaims incurred by such board and payable out of the funds within its\njurisdiction.\n  3. In a village which has established the office of auditor, the\nauditor shall audit and order paid all claims against the village. Such\norder shall be in the form prescribed in this chapter for similar orders\nof the village clerk. The auditor shall transmit such order directly to\nthe village treasurer and shall retain a duplicate thereof in his\noffice.\n  4. Except as hereinafter provided, no claim shall be ordered paid\nunless such claim is in writing and itemized and approved by the officer\nor employee whose action gave rise or origin to the claim. The board of\ntrustees may determine, by resolution, that claims shall be certified or\nverified by oath of the claimant or his duly authorized agent.\n  5. Fixed salaries, debt service, amounts becoming due upon lawful\ncontracts for periods exceeding one year and the compensation for\nservices of employees or officers regularly engaged by the village at\nagreed wages by the hour, day, week, month or year may be paid without\nprior audit. All payrolls, or other claims for compensation, for\npersonal services rendered to the village by any person other than an\nelective village officer shall be certified by the village officer or\nemployee having direct supervision of the claimant to the effect that\nsuch services indicated on such payroll or claim were actually performed\nby the person or persons mentioned therein. If the rules of the state\ncivil service commission, the county civil service commission or the\ncounty personnel officer, as the case may be, have been extended to\napply to any such employees or officers, no claim for compensation shall\nbe paid unless the payroll or claim shall have been certified by such\ncommission or personnel officer to the effect that the appointment or\nemployment of such officers and employees has been made in accordance\nwith the civil service law and rules.\n  6. The board of trustees may by resolution authorize payment in\nadvance of audit of claims for public utility services, postage, freight\nand express charges. All such claims shall be presented at the next\nregular meeting for audit, and the claimant and the officer incurring or\napproving the same shall be jointly and severally liable for any amount\ndisallowed by the board of trustees.\n  As used in this subdivision, the term public utility services shall\nmean electric, gas, water, sewer and telephone services.\n  7. The actual and necessary expenses of all officers, employees, and,\nwhen authorized by the board of trustees, the actual and necessary\nexpenses of the volunteer chief and assistant volunteer chiefs of the\nvillage fire department incurred in the performance of their official\nduties shall be a village charge. For the purposes of this subdivision\n"actual and necessary expenses", as it applies to a volunteer chief or\nassistant volunteer chief of the village fire department, means only\nsuch expenses incurred in the performance of their extra official duties\nas volunteer chief or assistant volunteer chief.

No such person, however, shall be allowed such expenses for\nattending a regional school unless his village shall be included within\nthe area of such region as established by the education department.\n  8.
