          <p>  § 10-1022 Fire inspection in contract areas. The chief officer of the\nfire department or fire company which is to furnish fire protection\nservice to a village under a contract for fire protection may inspect\n(1) any public building and (2) with the consent of the owner, any\nprivately-owned building, located within the village or the portion\nthereof required to be protected under such contract, for fire hazards,\nor such chief officer may delegate such power of inspection to an\nofficer or member of such department or company.\n  The term "building," as used in this section does not include a\nmultiple dwelling which may be inspected by such fire department or\ncompany under and pursuant to the provisions of subdivision four of\nsection three hundred three of the multiple residence law.\n  The failure of any such officer or member to discover and properly\nreport any such fire hazards or his or her neglect or omission to\nperform such duties shall not subject him or her, his or her fire\ndepartment, fire company, or the city, village, fire district or town in\nwhich or of which he or she is a firefighter to any civil or other\nliability. Any such fire officer or member shall not be liable civilly\nfor any act or acts done by him or her as a firefighter in the\nperformance of such duties, except for wilful negligence or malfeasance,\nbut the provisions of this section shall not relieve any such city,\nvillage, fire district, town, or fire company from liability, if any,\nfor the negligent or wrongful acts of the officer or member in the\nactual performance of such duty.\n</p>
