          <p>  § 14-1400 Establishment of sewerage system. The board of trustees of\nany village may, upon its own motion or shall upon the petition of\ntwenty five owners of real property within the village, according to the\nlast completed village assessment roll, cause a map and plan to be\nprepared for a complete sewerage system for the village. The board of\ntrustees may establish, extend and maintain a sewerage system, including\nlaterals, therein in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and\nmay, as provided by this chapter, abolish an existing sewer or\nwastewater disposal district created under the town, county or general\ndistrict law, coterminous with or wholly included in the limits of the\nvillage, and use the sewerage system of such abolished district as a\ncomplete village sewerage system or as a part or extension of any\nexisting village sewerage system. Before taking any proceeding for the\nconstruction of a sewerage system or any part thereof the board, at the\nexpense of the village, shall, unless such map and plan have been\nheretofore officially approved by the state commissioner of health and\ncopies filed in the state department of health and in the office of the\nvillage clerk, cause a map and plan of a permanent sewerage system for\nsuch village to be made, with plans and specifications for sewage\ntreatment or disposal works. It may also include any existing sewerage\nor private on-site wastewater disposal system in the village, which on\nexamination by the village engineer shall be found feasible and proper\nto incorporate or include in the proposed system. Such map and plan\nshall be comprehensive and shall cover all portions of the village, but\nthe village may construct the whole of the said system or may\ntemporarily omit any portion thereof until such portions may be\nnecessary, subject to the approval of such omission by the state\ncommissioner of health as hereinafter provided. Such map and plan shall\nbe submitted to the state commissioner of health for his approval, and\nif approved shall be filed in the office of the state commissioner of\nhealth. A copy thereof shall also be filed in the office of the village\nclerk. The map and plan may be amended, with the approval of the state\ncommissioner of health, and when so amended and approved shall be filed\nin the same offices as the original. No work of any kind shall be done\non or for the construction, extension, reconstruction, removal or\nmodification of any system of sewerage or of any part thereof until a\nmap and plan covering the entire system shall first have been duly\napproved and filed as above provided, and in the execution of the\nconstruction, extension, reconstruction, removal or modification of any\nsystem of sewerage or of any part thereof, no deviations from the plans\nas finally approved and filed shall be made until plans or descriptions\nadequately showing such deviations are first approved and filed as above\nprovided. Whenever the board of trustees of the village shall deem it\ndesirable to the interests of the village that a portion of the\npermanent general system of sewers, private on-site wastewater disposal\nsystems and sewage disposal thereof may be temporarily omitted or\ndeferred, it shall certify that fact in writing to the state\ncommissioner of health, designating by a map or otherwise the portions\nof the system to be omitted, or the portion not to be omitted, and on\nreceipt of the same the state commissioner of health may approve of such\ntemporary omission and shall certify his determination to the board of\ntrustees of the village. The term "sewerage system" as used in this\narticle shall be understood to mean a complete system for the removal,\ntreatment or disposal of sewage or wastewater, including private on-site\nwastewater disposal systems. The village board of trustees is authorized\nto establish and impose sewer rents pursuant to the provisions of\narticle fourteen-f of the general municipal law.\n</p>
