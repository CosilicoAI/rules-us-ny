          <p>  § 6-608 When village may relinquish care of bridges.  Any village\nwhich has the supervision, control, care and maintenance of any bridge\nor bridges wholly within its boundaries, or which has entered into an\nagreement with a town as provided in sections 6-604 and 6-606 of this\nchapter, may with the consent of the town board of the town within which\nany such bridge is situated, by resolution of the board of trustees\nsubject to a permissive referendum as defined in this chapter, terminate\nthe right of such village to supervise, control, care for and maintain\nsuch bridge or bridges, or cancel any such agreements made by it with\nsuch superintendants of highways, and thereafter every public bridge\nwithin the boundaries of said village shall be under the supervision,\ncontrol, care of and maintenance of the superintendants of highways of\nthe town as provided in section 6-602 of this chapter. Such action,\nhowever, shall in no way cancel or interfere with the validity of any\nobligation or indebtedness of the village incurred during the period\nthat the village exercised the supervision, control, care and\nmaintenance of such bridge or bridges, or during the period that said\nagreement was operative.\n</p>
