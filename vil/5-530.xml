Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously,\nillegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund\nthereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers, and such\nofficer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,\nsuch determination shall be reviewable by a proceeding under article\nseventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided, however,\nthat such proceeding is commenced within ninety days after the giving of\nthe notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due was not\npreviously made, and that an undertaking is filed with the proper fiscal\nofficer or officers in such amount and with such sureties as a justice\nof the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding\nbe dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and\ncharges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.\n  7.
