The delegates elected to the general\nconvention of the fire department shall meet at the council room thereof\non the Thursday following the first Tuesday in April, except the elected\ndelegates of the fire department of the village of Fishkill, Dutchess\ncounty, which shall meet on the first Tuesday in December, and nominate\na person for each of such offices and except the elected delegates of\nthe fire department of the village of Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester\ncounty, which shall meet on the Thursday following the first Tuesday in\nDecember; but the fire commissioners of any village may adopt a rule\nrequiring all such nominations to be made on the day of the meeting by a\nvote of the duly qualified members of the department, in which case the\nmeeting of the delegates in general convention, as provided for in this\nsection, shall be dispensed with. The person acting as secretary of such\nconvention shall forthwith file in the office of the village clerk a\ncertificate of such nominations. The board of fire commissioners at its\nnext meeting shall consider the nominations and appoint such persons to\nthe offices to which they are respectively nominated or, if a nomination\nis not approved the board shall reconvene the general convention, which\nshall submit a new nomination to take the place of any nomination not\napproved, which procedure shall continue until a full set of officers is\napproved. A person who has been convicted of arson in any degree shall\nnot be eligible for nomination, election or appointment to the office of\nchief or assistant chief.
