Such map is to be deemed to be final and\nconclusive with respect to the location and width of streets, highways,\ndrainage systems and the location of parks shown thereon. Such official\nmap is hereby declared to be established to conserve and promote the\npublic health, safety and general welfare. The clerk of every village\nwhich has established such an official map shall immediately file a\ncertificate of that fact with the clerk or register of the county in\nwhich said village is located.  Such board of trustees is authorized and\nempowered, whenever and as often as it may deem it for the public\ninterest, to change or add to the official map of the village so as to\nlay out new streets, highways or parks, or to widen or close existing\nstreets, highways or parks.

The granting by the board of trustees of a petition for the\napproval of the laying out, altering, widening, narrowing or\ndiscontinuing of a street, shall be deemed to be an addition or change\nof the official map and shall be subject to all the provisions of this\narticle with regard to such additions or changes.
