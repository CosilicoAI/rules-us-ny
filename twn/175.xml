Such resolution, if adopted, shall fix the amount of such\ncompensation as follows: if the hours during which the polls will be\nopen for the receipt of ballots are from six o'clock in the evening\nuntil nine o'clock in the evening, a sum not to exceed seventy dollars\nfor each such official; if additional consecutive hours prior to six\no'clock in the evening are determined and specified in the notice of\nelection, a sum not to exceed one hundred dollars for each such\nofficial.
