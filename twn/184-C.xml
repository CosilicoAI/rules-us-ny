The notice shall specify the time when and place where\nthe hearing shall be held, and shall describe in general terms what is\nproposed to be done pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n  The water and improvements shall be used for fire-fighting purposes\nonly and such water shall not be sold. The fire suction pools, fire\ncisterns and fire wells constructed and maintained for the purposes of\nany such district or unprotected area shall be fenced or covered to\nprevent trespass by children and domestic animals. Any such improvement\nshall be located upon real property within the fire protection district,\nfire alarm district, or unprotected area, which has been acquired by\ngift, purchase or lease, or upon which an easement has been acquired, by\nthe town board in the name of the town for the purposes of any such\ndistrict or area, except such portions of the improvement which are\nlocated within the bounds of public highways, roads or streets with the\nconsent of the state or local official charged with the supervision of\nthe highway, road or street.

The supervisor shall disburse such moneys\nfor the purposes aforesaid. Moneys shall not be borrowed to finance the\ncost of any expenditure made pursuant to this section.\n  If a fire protection district or fire alarm district shall be situated\npartly in each of two or more towns any action which would be taken by\nthe town board in the case of a district situated in only one town shall\nbe taken by the town boards of the several towns acting jointly by a\nmajority vote of the members of each of such town boards, and the notice\nof public hearing required by this section shall be given by the town\nclerks of the several towns acting jointly.\n  If, after proceeding pursuant to this section, an adequate supply of\nwater for fire-fighting purposes becomes available for such area, or if\na suitable supply may be obtained therefor by contract pursuant to\nsection one hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter, the town board,\nnevertheless, may continue to act in relation to any such district or\nunprotected area pursuant to this section.\n</p>
